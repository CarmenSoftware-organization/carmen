## Introduction

The Credit Note API allows clients to manage credit notes through a set of RESTful endpoints. This API enables operations such as creating, retrieving, and managing credit notes, as well as handling related entities like items, comments, attachments, and inventory adjustments.

Credit notes are documents issued to record and process returns or adjustments related to previously received goods or services. They are typically linked to purchase orders (POs) and goods received notes (GRNs).

## API Endpoints Organization

The Credit Note API endpoints are organized into the following categories:

1. **Core Operations**: Basic CRUD operations for credit notes
2. **Financial Operations**: Operations related to financial aspects like journal entries and tax entries
3. **Item Operations**: Operations for managing items within a credit note
4. **Attachment Operations**: Operations for managing file attachments
5. **Comment Operations**: Operations for managing comments and discussions
6. **Inventory Operations**: Operations for processing inventory adjustments related to returns

## Common Patterns

All Credit Note API endpoints follow these common patterns:

- **Authentication**: All endpoints require authentication using JWT tokens
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error response format with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Request/Response Format**: JSON format for all request and response bodies
- **Pagination**: List endpoints support pagination with `page` and `limit` parameters
- **Sorting**: List endpoints support sorting with `sortBy` and `order` parameters
- **Filtering**: List endpoints support filtering with various query parameters
