- Unit price entry with support for tax-inclusive pricing
- Automatic calculation of subtotal based on receiving quantity Ã— unit price
- Adjustable discount rate with override option for discount amount
- Adjustable tax rate with override option for tax amount
- Automatic recalculation of:
  - Subtotal Amount = Receiving Quantity Ã— Unit Price
  - Discount Amount = Subtotal Ã— Discount Rate (or manual override)
  - Net Amount = Subtotal - Discount
  - Tax Amount = Net Amount Ã— Tax Rate (or manual override)
  - Total Amount = Net Amount + Tax Amount

**Detailed Calculation Logic:**

The system performs calculations based on whether the price entered is tax-inclusive or tax-exclusive.

**1. Tax Inclusive Pricing (e.g., VAT is included in the Unit Price)**

-   **Price**: The unit price entered by the user (includes tax).
-   **Subtotal**: `Price * Received Quantity (excluding FOC)`
-   **Discount Amount**: Calculated based on Discount Rate or manual override.
-   **Tax Amount**: `round((Subtotal - Discount Amount) * Tax Rate / (100 + Tax Rate), 2)`
-   **Net Amount**: `Subtotal - Discount Amount - Tax Amount`
-   **Total Amount**: `Net Amount + Tax Amount` (Should equal Subtotal - Discount Amount)
-   **Last Price**: `Net Amount / Received Quantity (excluding FOC)`
-   **Last Cost**: `(Net Amount + Extra Costs) / (Received Quantity + FOC Quantity)`

*Example: Coke 2 cans at 25 THB each (includes 7% VAT), with a 5 THB discount.*

-   *Price = 25*
-   *Subtotal = 25 * 2 = 50*
-   *Discount Amount = 5*
-   *Tax Amount = round((50 - 5) * 7 / 107, 2) = round(45 * 7 / 107, 2) = round(2.9439..., 2) = 2.94*
-   *Net Amount = 50 - 5 - 2.94 = 42.06*
-   *Total Amount = 42.06 + 2.94 = 45*
-   *Last Price = 42.06 / 2 = 21.03*

**2. Tax Exclusive Pricing (e.g., VAT is added to the Unit Price)**

-   **Price**: The unit price entered by the user (excludes tax).
-   **Subtotal**: `Price * Received Quantity (excluding FOC)`
-   **Discount Amount**: Calculated based on Discount Rate or manual override.
-   **Net Amount**: `Subtotal - Discount Amount`
-   **Tax Amount**: `round(Net Amount * Tax Rate / 100, 2)`
-   **Total Amount**: `Net Amount + Tax Amount`
-   **Last Price**: `Net Amount / Received Quantity (excluding FOC)`
-   **Last Cost**: `(Net Amount + Extra Costs) / (Received Quantity + FOC Quantity)`

*Example: Coke 2 cans at 25 THB each (add 7% VAT), with a 5 THB discount.*

-   *Price = 25*
-   *Subtotal = 25 * 2 = 50*
-   *Discount Amount = 5*
-   *Net Amount = 50 - 5 = 45*
-   *Tax Amount = round(45 * 7 / 100, 2) = round(3.15, 2) = 3.15*
-   *Total Amount = 45 + 3.15 = 48.15*
-   *Last Price = 45 / 2 = 22.50*

**Handling Free of Charge (FOC) Items:**

-   FOC items do not contribute to the Subtotal calculation.
-   The quantity of FOC items is included when calculating the `Last Cost` but excluded for `Last Price`.
