# Recipe Module - API Endpoints Overview

**Status**: Draft  
**Last Updated**: March 27, 2024

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the API endpoints available in the Recipe Management module. It serves as an index to the detailed API documentation and offers a high-level understanding of the available operations.

## API Endpoints Organization

The Recipe Management API endpoints are organized into the following categories:

1. **Core Operations**: Basic CRUD operations for recipes
2. **Category Operations**: Endpoints for managing recipe categories
3. **Ingredient Operations**: Endpoints for managing recipe ingredients
4. **Attachment Operations**: Endpoints for managing recipe media attachments
5. **Comment Operations**: Endpoints for managing recipe comments

## Common Patterns

### Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using JWT tokens. Include the token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Request Format

- GET requests use query parameters for filtering and pagination
- POST, PUT, and PATCH requests accept JSON bodies
- DELETE requests typically don't require a request body

### Response Format

All responses follow a standard format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "message": "Operation successful",
  "errors": []
}
```

For error responses:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "data": null,
  "message": "Operation failed",
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "ERROR_CODE",
      "message": "Detailed error message"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Pagination

List endpoints support pagination with the following query parameters:

- `page`: Page number (default: 1)
- `limit`: Items per page (default: 20, max: 100)
- `sort`: Field to sort by (e.g., `name`, `updatedAt`)
- `order`: Sort order (`asc` or `desc`, default: `asc`)

Paginated responses include metadata:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "items": [ ... ],
    "pagination": {
      "total": 100,
      "page": 1,
      "limit": 20,
      "pages": 5
    }
  },
  "message": "Operation successful",
  "errors": []
}
```
