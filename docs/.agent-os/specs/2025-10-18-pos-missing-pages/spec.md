# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: POS Integration Missing Pages Implementation
> Created: 2025-10-18

## Overview

Implement four critical POS Integration pages to complete the module's functionality: Stock-out Review for approval workflows, Transaction Detail drawer for comprehensive transaction inspection, Mapping Drawer modal for efficient recipe mapping, and Failed Transaction view for error resolution. These pages will enhance the POS Integration module by providing essential workflows for transaction approval, detailed inspection, mapping management, and error handling.

## User Stories

### Stock-out Review and Approval

As a store manager, I want to review and approve stock-out transactions before they affect inventory, so that I can prevent unauthorized or erroneous inventory deductions.

**Workflow:**
- Manager navigates to Stock-out Review page from POS Integration dashboard
- Views pending approval queue with transaction details and inventory impact preview
- Filters by location, date range, or requester
- Reviews individual transactions with full line item details
- Approves, rejects, or requests more information with notes
- Performs bulk approval/rejection for multiple transactions
- System updates inventory only after approval and logs all decisions

### Transaction Inspection and Troubleshooting

As a purchasing staff member, I want to view detailed transaction information and audit logs, so that I can investigate discrepancies and understand transaction processing history.

**Workflow:**
- User clicks on any transaction from the transactions list
- Transaction Detail drawer slides out showing complete information
- Reviews transaction header, line items, and inventory deductions
- Examines audit log with timestamps and user actions
- For failed transactions, views error details and troubleshooting suggestions
- Can retry failed transactions or mark them for manual resolution
- Closes drawer to return to transaction list

### Efficient Recipe Mapping

As a system administrator, I want to quickly map POS items to recipes through an intuitive modal interface, so that I can efficiently configure the integration without navigating away from the mapping list.

**Workflow:**
- Admin views unmapped items in Recipe Mapping page
- Clicks "Map" button on an unmapped item
- Mapping Drawer modal opens with item details pre-populated
- Searches and selects target recipe from dropdown
- Configures portion size and unit of measurement
- Optionally overrides cost calculation
- Previews inventory impact before saving
- Saves mapping and modal closes, returning to updated list

## Spec Scope

1. **Stock-out Review Page** - Full-featured approval queue with filtering, bulk operations, and detailed transaction preview including inventory impact
2. **Transaction Detail Drawer** - Comprehensive slide-out panel displaying transaction header, line items, inventory deductions, audit log, and action buttons
3. **Mapping Drawer Modal** - Streamlined recipe mapping interface with search, portion configuration, cost override, and inventory impact preview
4. **Failed Transaction View** - Error resolution interface with categorized errors, troubleshooting suggestions, retry mechanism, and manual resolution options
5. **API Integration** - Backend endpoints for approvals, transaction details, mapping operations, and retry mechanisms

## Out of Scope

- Multi-level approval workflows (single-level approval only)
- Automated approval rules based on transaction amount
- Email notifications for approval requests
- Advanced analytics on approval patterns
- Integration with external approval systems
- Bulk mapping operations (focus on single-item mapping)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Fully functional Stock-out Review page at `/system-administration/system-integrations/pos/transactions/stock-out-review` with approval queue, filtering, and bulk operations
2. Transaction Detail drawer accessible from all transaction list views, displaying complete transaction information with retry/resolve capabilities
3. Mapping Drawer modal triggered from Recipe Mapping page, enabling efficient single-item recipe mapping with validation and preview
4. Failed Transaction view displaying error details, troubleshooting guidance, and resolution options when viewing failed transactions
