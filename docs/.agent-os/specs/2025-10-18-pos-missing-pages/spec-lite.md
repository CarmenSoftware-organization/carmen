# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement four essential POS Integration pages to complete the module: Stock-out Review for transaction approval workflows, Transaction Detail drawer for comprehensive inspection, Mapping Drawer modal for efficient recipe mapping, and Failed Transaction view for error resolution. These features will enable managers to approve inventory-affecting transactions, staff to investigate transaction details, administrators to quickly configure mappings, and users to resolve transaction errors with guided troubleshooting.
