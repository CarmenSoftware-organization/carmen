secondaryFilters: dynamicStageList // Based on user's assigned workflow stages
```

## 6. Workflow-Based Permissions

### 6.1. Workflow Stage Assignment Rules

Permissions are dynamically determined based on workflow configuration:

```typescript
// Users assigned to specific workflow stages can:
// 1. View PRs at their assigned stage
// 2. Perform actions available at that stage
// 3. See PRs in their approval queue

const stagePermissions = {
  "Request Creation": {
    assignedRoles: ["Requester"],
    availableActions: ["Submit"],
    viewScope: "own"
  },
  "Department Approval": {
    assignedRoles: ["Department Head"],
    availableActions: ["Approve", "Reject", "Send Back"],
    viewScope: "department"
  },
  "Finance Review": {
    assignedRoles: ["Finance Manager"],
    availableActions: ["Approve", "Reject", "Send Back"],
    viewScope: "all"
  },
  "Purchasing Review": {
    assignedRoles: ["Purchasing Staff"],
    availableActions: ["Approve", "Reject", "Send Back"],
    viewScope: "all"
  },
  "Final Approval": {
    assignedRoles: ["General Manager"],
    availableActions: ["Approve", "Reject", "Send Back"],
    viewScope: "all"
  }
};
```

### 6.2. Approval Stage Permissions

| Workflow Stage | Who Can Approve | Who Can Reject | Who Can View | Assignment Method |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Department Approval** | Users assigned to stage | Users assigned to stage | Requestor, Assigned Users, Admin | Workflow Configuration |
| **Finance Review** | Users assigned to stage | Users assigned to stage | All above + Assigned Users | Workflow Configuration |
| **Purchasing Review** | Users assigned to stage | Users assigned to stage | All above + Assigned Users | Workflow Configuration |
| **Final Approval** | Users assigned to stage | Users assigned to stage | All roles | Workflow Configuration |

### 6.2. Status-Based Action Permissions

| PR Status | Edit | Delete | Submit | Approve | Reject |
|-----------|------|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| **Draft** | Requestor/Admin | Requestor/Admin | Requestor/Admin | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Submitted** | Admin only | Admin only | ❌ | Stage Approver | Stage Approver |
| **In Progress** | Admin only | Admin only | ❌ | Stage Approver | Stage Approver |
| **Approved** | Admin only | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Purchasing Manager |
| **Rejected** | Requestor/Admin | Requestor/Admin | Requestor/Admin | ❌ | ❌ |

## 7. Dynamic Permission Evaluation

### 7.1. Context-Sensitive Permissions

The system evaluates permissions dynamically based on:

- **User Role**: Primary role assignment
- **Department Hierarchy**: User's position in organizational structure
- **PR Ownership**: Whether user created the PR
- **Workflow Stage**: Current stage of PR approval
- **PR Status**: Current status of the PR
- **Business Rules**: Custom rules based on amount, category, etc.

### 7.2. Permission Evaluation Logic

```typescript
function canPerformAction(user: User, pr: PurchaseRequest, action: string): boolean {
  // Base role check
  if (!hasBasePermission(user.role, action)) return false;
  
  // Ownership check
  if (requiresOwnership(action) && pr.requestorId !== user.id && !isAdmin(user)) return false;
  
  // Department check
  if (requiresDepartmentAccess(action) && !hasAccessToDepartment(user, pr.department)) return false;
  
  // Workflow stage check
  if (isWorkflowAction(action) && !canApproveAtStage(user, pr.currentWorkflowStage)) return false;
  
  // Status check
  if (!isValidForStatus(action, pr.status)) return false;
  
  // Business rule check
  if (!passesBusinessRules(user, pr, action)) return false;
  
  return true;
}
```

## 8. UI Element Visibility Rules

### 8.1. Button Visibility

| UI Element | Visibility Rule |
|------------|-----------------|
| **New PR Button** | Visible if user can create PRs |
| **Edit Button** | Visible if user can edit specific PR |
| **Delete Button** | Visible if user can delete specific PR |
| **Approve Button** | Visible if user can approve at current stage |
| **Reject Button** | Visible if user can reject at current stage |
| **Bulk Actions** | Visible if user has bulk permissions |
| **Export Button** | Visible based on data access level |

### 8.2. Menu Item Visibility

|-----------|-----------------|
| **Duplicate** | Always visible for viewable PRs |
| **Print** | Visible for viewable PRs |
| **Share** | Visible if user has sharing permissions |
