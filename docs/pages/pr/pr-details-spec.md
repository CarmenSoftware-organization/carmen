### 1.7. Enhanced Floating Workflow Actions (Workflow Decision Engine)

The floating action menu has been transformed into an intelligent system powered by the **Workflow Decision Engine** that analyzes item statuses and determines appropriate workflow actions.

**Workflow Decision Engine Features:**
```typescript
interface WorkflowDecision {
  canSubmit: boolean;
  action: 'approve' | 'reject' | 'return' | 'blocked';
  buttonText: string;
  buttonVariant: 'default' | 'destructive' | 'outline' | 'secondary';
  buttonColor?: string;
  reason: string;
  itemsSummary: {
    approved: number;
    rejected: number;
    review: number;
    pending: number;
    total: number;
  };
}
```

**Priority-Based Decision Logic:**
1. **All Rejected** → `Submit & Reject` (red destructive button)
2. **Any Review** → `Submit & Return` (orange outline button)
3. **Any Pending** → `Review Required` (blocked, gray secondary button)
4. **Any Approved** → `Submit & Approve` (green default button)

**Smart Action Button Features:**
- **Dynamic Text**: Button text changes based on workflow analysis
- **Color Coding**: Visual indicators for action type (green=approve, red=reject, orange=review)
- **Contextual Tooltips**: Explains why action is available or blocked
- **Item Summary**: Shows count breakdown (e.g., "3 Approved, 1 Review")
- **Role-Based Visibility**: Actions only shown to authorized users

**Enhanced Workflow Actions:**
- **Smart Approval**: Only enabled when items are ready for approval
- **Intelligent Blocking**: Prevents submission when items need attention
- **Return Step Selector**: Modal for choosing which stage to return to
- **Bulk Comment Support**: Add comments that apply to all workflow actions
- **Real-time Updates**: Action availability updates as item statuses change

## 2. Enhanced Items Tab with Expandable Panel System (`ItemsTab.tsx`)

  availableActions: string[];
}

const getBulkActions = (context: BulkActionContext): BulkAction[] => {
  const actions = [];
  
  // Role-based action availability
  if (canApprove(context.userRole, context.workflowStage)) {
    const approvableItems = context.selectedItems.filter(item => 
      ['Pending', 'Review'].includes(item.status)
    );
    if (approvableItems.length > 0) {
      actions.push({
        type: 'approve',
        label: `Approve ${approvableItems.length} Items`,
        variant: 'default',
