  poId: string                  // Unique identifier
  number: string                // PO reference number
  vendorId: number             // Vendor reference
  vendorName: string           // Vendor name
  orderDate: Date              // Order date
  DeliveryDate?: Date          // Expected delivery
  status: PurchaseOrderStatus  // Current status
  currencyCode: string         // Currency code
  exchangeRate: number         // Exchange rate
  items: PurchaseOrderItem[]   // Line items
  baseSubTotalPrice: number    // Subtotal in base currency
  subTotalPrice: number        // Subtotal in order currency
  baseNetAmount: number        // Net amount in base currency
  netAmount: number            // Net amount in order currency

  // ... additional fields
}
```

### Purchase Request Entity
```typescript

  id: string                   // Unique identifier
  refNumber: string           // Reference number

```

## 5. Logic Implementation

### Purchase Order Processing
- PR to PO conversion rules:
  - Approved PR required
  - Vendor selection validation
  - Budget availability check
  - Currency conversion if applicable
  - Tax and discount application
  - Total amount calculation

### Approval Workflow
- Hierarchical approval based on:
  - Amount thresholds
  - Department
  - Item categories
  - Budget impact
- Status transitions:
  - Draft → Pending → Approved/Rejected
  - Additional approvals for exceptions

### Budget Control
- Available budget calculation:
  - Total Budget
  - Less: Soft commitments (PR)
  - Less: Hard commitments (PO)
  - Less: Actual spend
  - Equals: Available budget

## 6. Validation and Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. Purchase Request Creation
   - Create with minimum required fields
   - Create with all fields
   - Validate budget check
   - Test approval routing

2. Purchase Order Processing
   - Convert PR to PO
   - Add/modify line items
   - Apply taxes and discounts
   - Currency conversion

3. Goods Receipt
   - Full receipt
   - Partial receipt
   - Quality check failures
   - Discrepancy handling

### Error Handling
- Budget exceeded
- Invalid vendor selection
- Missing required fields
- Currency conversion errors
