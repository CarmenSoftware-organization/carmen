- **VPL_042**: Quantity break cost = Round(Base Cost × Break Factor, 2)
- **VPL_043**: Currency conversion = Round(Cost × Exchange Rate, 2)
- **VPL_044**: Landed cost = Round(Base Cost + Round(Sum of Extra Costs, 2), 2)

- **VPL_CON_004**: Support multi-year contracts
- **VPL_CON_005**: Allow cost protection periods

### 3.10 Vendor Price Comparison Rules
- **VPL_CMP_001**: The system must enable side-by-side comparison of vendor prices for identical or similar products. This comparison should normalize all costs to a common unit of measure and currency, incorporating exchange rates, landed costs, and quantity break pricing. The comparison must also factor in vendor-specific terms such as payment terms, lead times, and minimum order quantities to calculate the true cost of procurement.

- **VPL_CMP_002**: Price comparison analysis must include historical pricing trends and future price projections. The system should maintain a rolling 12-month price history for each vendor-product combination, calculate price volatility metrics, and highlight significant price variations. This historical data should be used to generate cost-saving opportunities and identify vendors with stable pricing patterns. The analysis should also consider seasonal price variations and market indices for commodity-based products.

- **VPL_CMP_003**: The comparison engine must support weighted scoring of vendors based on multiple criteria beyond just price. This includes vendor performance metrics (quality, on-time delivery, order fill rate), financial terms (payment terms, early payment discounts), and operational factors (lead times, minimum order quantities). The system should calculate a total cost of ownership (TCO) score that combines all these factors, enabling procurement officers to make informed decisions based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria.
