### Consumption Analytics Dashboard
![Consumption Analytics Dashboard](./screenshots/consumption-analytics.png)
*The Consumption Analytics dashboard provides real-time business intelligence with comprehensive monitoring across 5 functional tabs. Active Alerts section displays 2 critical alerts: "High Variance Detected" for Premium Coffee Beans (Variance: 18.5%, Expected: 8%) and WARNING alert for "Stock Level Low" on Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Current: 15 kg, Reorder: 20 kg). Six KPI widgets track: Food Cost % (32.5% current vs 30% target, red indicator), Waste % (2.8% vs 3% target, green), Fractional Rate (68.5% conversion rate), Avg Transaction ($45.20 value), Profit Margin (38.2% with Grade: Good), and Yield Efficiency (94.5% with Performance: Excellent). Two analytical charts visualize: Consumption Trends (7-day line chart showing theoretical consumption 850-1150kg, actual consumption 900-1200kg, waste 50-100kg from Mon-Sun) and Sales Distribution (area chart comparing Fractional Sales 450-750 units vs Whole Sales 300-500 units). Navigation tabs (Overview, Fractional Sales, Variance, Ingredients, Efficiency) and filter controls (Location: All Locations, Time Range: This Week) enable comprehensive consumption analysis and optimization.*

## Business Rules

### Consumption Calculation Rules

1. **Theoretical Consumption**:
   - Calculated from recipe specifications and sales volumes
   - Includes standard wastage factors from recipe definitions
   - Based on yield variants for fractional sales

2. **Actual Consumption**:
   - Physical inventory deductions
   - Includes all wastage, spillage, and adjustments
   - Tracked per consumption period

3. **Variance Thresholds**:
   - Acceptable: â‰¤ 8% variance
   - Warning: 8-15% variance
   - Critical: > 15% variance

### Fractional Sales Rules

1. **Conversion Rates**:
   - Pizza slice: 1/8 of base recipe (0.125)
   - Cake slice: 1/12 of base recipe (0.083)
   - Bottle glass: 1/5 of base recipe (0.200)
   - Custom portions: User-defined rates

2. **Efficiency Targets**:
   - Minimum efficiency: 85%
   - Target efficiency: 90%+
   - Maximum waste: 5%

3. **Inventory Deduction**:
   - Fractional sales deduct from prepared item inventory
   - Prepared items have shelf life tracking
   - Automatic waste generation when shelf life expires

### Alert Generation Rules

1. **Stock Low Alert**:
   - Triggered when current level < 2x reorder point
   - Severity: Warning

2. **Stock Critical Alert**:
   - Triggered when current level < reorder point
   - Severity: Critical
   - Recommended action: Order immediately

3. **Variance High Alert**:
   - Triggered when variance > acceptable threshold (8%)
   - Severity: Warning for 8-15%, Critical for >15%
   - Recommended action: Review procedures

4. **Waste Warning Alert**:
   - Triggered when waste % > target (3%)
   - Severity: Info for 3-5%, Warning for >5%
   - Recommended action: Investigate causes

### Period Management Rules

1. **Consumption Periods**:
   - Daily, weekly, monthly, or custom periods
   - One active period per location
   - Period must be closed before new period starts

2. **Period Closing**:
   - Requires physical inventory verification
   - Calculates final variances
   - Archives data for historical analysis
   - Locks consumption records to prevent changes
