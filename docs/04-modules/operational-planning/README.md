### Recipe Management

#### Recipe Library
![Recipe Library](./screenshots/recipe-library.png)
*The Recipe Library displays 5 comprehensive recipe cards with detailed analytics: Thai Green Curry ($4.75 cost, $16.99 selling price, 72.0% margin, 1.2 kg CO‚ÇÇeq), Beef Bourguignon ($8.50 cost, $28.99 selling, 70.7% margin, 2.8 kg CO‚ÇÇeq), Tiramisu ($2.25 cost, $8.99 selling, 74.9% margin, 0.8 kg CO‚ÇÇeq), Margherita Pizza ($14.80 cost, $34.99 selling, 57.7% margin, 2.1 kg CO‚ÇÇeq), and Chocolate Pound Cake ($20.00 cost, $89.99 selling, 77.8% margin, 1.8 kg CO‚ÇÇeq). Each recipe card shows cuisine type, course category, and CO‚ÇÇ environmental impact tracking. The interface includes search functionality, filters (No Media, Has Media, Active, Draft), Advanced Filters, Import/Export capabilities, and a New Recipe button.*

#### Recipe Categories
![Recipe Categories](./screenshots/recipe-categories.png)
*The Recipe Categories interface shows a hierarchical table structure with 3 main categories: Appetizers (APP, 45 recipes, 38 active, $4.50 avg cost, 68.5% avg margin), Main Courses (MAIN, 80 recipes, 65 active, $12.50 avg cost, 63.5% avg margin - expandable for subcategories), and Desserts (DES, 35 recipes, 30 active, $3.75 avg cost, 72.5% avg margin). The tree structure features expand/collapse controls, Edit/Delete/Add actions per node, search functionality, filters (No Recipes, Has Recipes, Top Level, Sub Level), and Import/Export/Print buttons for comprehensive recipe organization management.*

#### Cuisine Types
![Cuisine Types](./screenshots/cuisine-types.png)
*The Cuisine Types management interface displays 8 global cuisine classifications with regional groupings: Italian (ITA, Europe, 45 recipes, 38 active), Chinese (CHN, Asia, 60 recipes, 52 active), Mexican (MEX, Americas, 35 recipes, 30 active), Indian (IND, Asia, 50 recipes, 45 active), French (FRA, Europe, 40 recipes, 35 active), Japanese (JPN, Asia, 55 recipes, 48 active), Mediterranean (MED, Europe, 30 recipes, 25 active), and Thai (THA, Asia, 45 recipes, 40 active). The interface provides search functionality, filters (No Recipes, Has Recipes, Asian, European), More Filters option, and Import/Export/Print capabilities for cuisine type management.*

### Menu Engineering

#### Menu Engineering Dashboard
![Menu Engineering Dashboard](./screenshots/menu-engineering-dashboard.png)
*The Menu Engineering Dashboard showcases comprehensive menu optimization using the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix. Key performance indicators include Total Items (4), Total Revenue ($26,000, +8.2%), Avg Contribution ($20.38), Active Alerts (3, including 1 critical), and Portfolio Health (75%). The BCG matrix scatter plot categorizes menu items into four strategic quadrants: Stars (High popularity, High profitability - Promote strategy), Plow Horses (High popularity, Low profitability - Increase prices or reduce costs), Puzzles (Low popularity, High profitability - Increase marketing), and Dogs (Low popularity, Low profitability - Consider removing). Date range filtering (Jan 01, 2024 - Oct 17, 2025), category and location filters, and tabs for Performance Matrix, Portfolio Analysis, Recipe Details, Cost Alerts, and Data Import enable comprehensive menu performance management.*
