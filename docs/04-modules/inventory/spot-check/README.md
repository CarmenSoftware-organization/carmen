## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Key Components
- **NewSpotCheckForm** - Form with real-time item preview
- **CountDetailForm** - Interactive counting interface
- **CountListItem** - List view component
- **CountDetailCard** - Grid view component
- **Dashboard panels** - Statistics, activities, and monitoring

### Core Features
- Form validation with Zod schemas

## 📊 Data Flow

1. **Creation**: User configures criteria → System selects items → Creates count session
2. **Execution**: Counter enters actual counts → System calculates variances → Tracks progress
3. **Completion**: Final submission → Results stored → Analytics updated

## 🎨 UI Elements

### Status Indicators
- **Pending**: Blue badges for not-started sessions
- **In Progress**: Green badges for active counting
- **Completed**: Gray badges for finished counts
- **Paused**: Yellow badges for temporarily suspended sessions

### Interactive Elements
- Dropdown filters (status, department, location)
- Search functionality across all data fields
- View toggles (list/grid) with persistent state
- Progress bars with real-time updates
