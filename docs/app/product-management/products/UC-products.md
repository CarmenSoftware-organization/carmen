## Overview

This document details all use cases for the Products sub-module within the CARMEN hospitality ERP system. The use cases cover the complete product lifecycle from creation through deletion, including unit management, store assignments, cost tracking, tax configuration, and integration with dependent modules.

Products serve as the central master data repository for all operational modules including Procurement, Inventory Management, Recipe Management, Store Operations, Sales, and Finance. The use cases reflect this central role by detailing both direct user interactions and system-to-system integrations.

## System Use Cases

### UC-PROD-101: Update Last Receiving Cost

**Description**: When a Goods Receipt Note (GRN) is posted for a product, the system automatically updates the product's Last Receiving Cost, Last Receiving Date, and Last Receiving Vendor fields.

**Trigger**: GRN posted/completed for product

**Actor(s)**:
- **Primary**: GRN Module (automated)
- **Secondary**: Product module receives update

**Priority**: High

**Frequency**: Real-time (triggered by each GRN posting)

**Preconditions**:
- GRN record exists and is being posted/completed
- GRN contains product line items with unit cost
- Product exists in products table
- GRN status changing to "Posted" or "Completed"

**Postconditions**:
- **Success**: Product Last Receiving Cost, Date, and Vendor updated, activity log entry created
- **Failure**: GRN posting continues, error logged for manual correction

**Main Flow**:
1. GRN Module initiates GRN posting process
2. GRN Module iterates through each product line item in GRN
3. For each product, GRN Module extracts:
   - Product ID
   - Unit Cost (in base currency)
   - Receipt Date
   - Vendor ID/Name
4. GRN Module calls Product Module API: `updateLastReceivingCost(productId, cost, date, vendor)`
5. Product Module receives API call
6. Product Module validates input data:
   - Product ID exists
   - Cost is numeric and >= 0
   - Date is valid timestamp
   - Vendor is valid string
7. Product Module updates product record:
   - lastReceivingCost = received cost
   - lastReceivingDate = receipt date
   - lastReceivingVendor = vendor name
   - updatedAt = current timestamp
   - updatedBy = 'system' or GRN user ID
8. Product Module creates activity log entry:
   - activityType = 'COST_CHANGED'
   - description = 'Last receiving cost updated from GRN [GRN_NUMBER]'
   - oldValue = previous cost (serialized)
   - newValue = new cost (serialized)
   - fieldName = 'lastReceivingCost'
9. Product Module returns success response to GRN Module
10. GRN Module continues with next product line item
11. All product costs updated successfully
12. Process completes

**Alternative Flows**:

**Alt-101A: Multiple Products in Single GRN** (At step 2)
- GRN contains 10+ different products
- System processes each product sequentially
- Updates made independently (one failure doesn't affect others)
- Continue to step 3 for each product

**Alt-101B: Same Product Multiple Times in GRN** (At step 3)
- GRN line items include same product multiple times (different batch/lot)
- System processes each line item
- Last line item processed becomes the "last receiving cost"
- Only single activity log entry created (not one per line)
- Continue to step 4

**Alt-101C: Cost Unchanged** (At step 7)
- New cost equals current last receiving cost
- System updates date and vendor but not cost
- Activity log records date/vendor change only
- Continue to step 9

**Exception Flows**:

**Exc-101A: Product Not Found** (At step 6)
- Product ID does not exist in products table (data integrity issue)
- System logs error: "Product [ID] not found during GRN cost update"
- System continues processing other products (non-fatal)
- GRN posting continues
- Admin notification sent for investigation
- Process continues

**Exc-101B: Invalid Cost Value** (At step 6)
- Cost is negative or non-numeric
- System logs validation error
- System skips cost update for this product
- Activity log records attempted update with validation failure
- GRN posting continues
- Admin notification sent
- Process continues

**Exc-101C: Database Update Failure** (At step 7)
- Database update fails (connection timeout, constraint violation)
- System logs database error with full context
- System does NOT retry automatically (to prevent race conditions)
- GRN posting continues
- Admin notification sent with error details
- Process continues (non-fatal to GRN posting)

**Exc-101D: Activity Log Service Unavailable** (At step 8)
- Activity logging service is down
- Cost update succeeds but log entry fails
- System logs logging failure separately
- GRN posting continues (logging is non-critical)
- Process completes

**Data Contract**:

**Input Data Requirements**:
- **productId**: UUID - Product identifier from GRN line item
- **unitCost**: Decimal(10,2) - Cost per unit in base currency (positive, non-zero)
- **receiptDate**: Timestamp - Date GRN was received (not future date)
- **vendorName**: String(255) - Vendor name from GRN header

**Validation Rules**:
- productId must exist in products table
- unitCost must be >= 0, max 2 decimals
- receiptDate must be valid timestamp, not future
- vendorName max 255 characters

**Output Data Structure**:
- **status**: 'success' | 'partial' | 'failure'
- **updatedProducts**: Array of product IDs successfully updated
- **failedProducts**: Array of {productId, reason} for failures
- **transactionId**: UUID for this batch update

**Business Rules**:
- **BR-PROD-016**: Costs stored in base currency only
- **BR-PROD-021**: Last receiving cost is most recent GRN cost
- **BR-PROD-022**: Cost changes logged to activity log

**SLA**:
- **Processing Time**: <100ms per product
- **Availability**: 99.9% (follows GRN module availability)
- **Recovery Time**: Manual correction via admin interface if automated update fails

**Monitoring**:
- Count of cost updates per day
- Average update time per product
- Error rate (% of failed updates)
- Validation failure count by reason

**Rollback Procedure**:
If incorrect cost update detected:
1. Query activity log for original cost value
2. Admin manually updates product via UI to correct value
3. Activity log records manual correction
4. GRN remains unchanged (source of truth)

**Related Requirements**:
- FR-PROD-008: Cost Tracking
- Integration with GRN Module

- All entries share same timestamp and transaction
- Each entry has specific fieldName, oldValue, newValue
- Continue to step 4

**Alt-102B: Bulk Operation** (At step 3)
- Bulk import updated 100 products
- System creates activity log entry for each product
- All entries tagged with batch identifier in description
- Entries processed efficiently in batch insert
- Continue to step 4

**Alt-102C: System-Triggered Change** (At step 3)
- Change triggered by automated process (e.g., GRN cost update)
- userId = system service account or 'SYSTEM'
- ipAddress = server IP or null
- userAgent = 'System Process' or service name
- Continue to step 4

**Exception Flows**:

**Exc-102A: Activity Log Insert Fails** (At step 4)
- Product update succeeds but log insert fails (disk full, service down)
- Database transaction configured with:
  - Option 1: Rollback entire transaction (strict audit requirement)
  - Option 2: Commit product change, log failure separately (availability priority)
- System logs logging failure to separate error log
- If Option 1: Product change fails with error message
- If Option 2: Product change succeeds, background job retries logging
- Admin notification sent for logging failures

**Exc-102B: Activity Log Service Unavailable** (At step 5)
- Activity log database partition unavailable
- System queues log entry to message queue for later processing
- Product change succeeds
- Background job processes queued entries when service recovers
- Process completes

**Exc-102C: Serialization Error** (At step 3)
- Complex object (nested data) fails JSON serialization
- System logs serialization error
- System uses simple string representation as fallback
- Activity log entry created with "Serialization Error" note
- Product change continues
- Process completes

**Data Contract**:

**Input Data Requirements**:
- **productId**: UUID - Product being changed
- **userId**: UUID - User making change (or 'SYSTEM')

## Integration Use Cases

### UC-PROD-201: Product Selection in Procurement

**Description**: Procurement module retrieves product data for purchase request and purchase order entry, including validation of costs and deviations.

**Actor(s)**:
- **Primary**: Procurement Module
- **External System**: Product Module

**Trigger**: User creating/editing Purchase Request or Purchase Order

**Integration Type**: REST API

**Direction**: Outbound (Procurement calls Product)

**Priority**: Critical

**Frequency**: Real-time (every PR/PO entry)

**Preconditions**:
- Products exist in product master
- User is authenticated in procurement module
- Product API service is available

**Postconditions**:
- **Success**: Product data retrieved, displayed in procurement form, validation rules applied
- **Failure**: Error message displayed, procurement entry blocked until resolved

**Main Flow** (Outbound Example):
1. User is creating Purchase Request in Procurement module
2. User begins typing product code or description in product selection field
3. Procurement module sends type-ahead search request to Product API:
   - Endpoint: GET /api/products/search?q=[term]&active=true
   - Query includes: search term, active status filter, limit=10
4. Product API receives request
5. Product API queries products table with full-text search
6. Product API returns top 10 matching active products with data:
   - Product ID, Product Code, English Description, Category Path
   - Inventory Unit, Default Order Unit, Standard Cost
   - Price Deviation %, Quantity Deviation %
7. Procurement module receives response (JSON array)
8. Procurement module displays dropdown with search results
9. User selects product from dropdown
10. Procurement module populates form fields with product data:
    - Product code and description (read-only)
    - Unit dropdown (pre-populated with product's order units)
    - Unit price field (defaulted to standard cost)
    - Quantity field (blank for user entry)
11. User enters quantity and unit price
12. Procurement module validates price against deviation limit:
    - Calculate: |Unit Price - Standard Cost| / Standard Cost * 100
    - Compare to product's price deviation %
13. If within deviation: allow save
14. If exceeds deviation: display warning, require approval override
15. User completes PR/PO entry
16. Process completes

**Alternative Flows**:

**Alt-201A: Product Detail Lookup** (After step 9)
- User needs full product information before selecting
- User clicks "View Details" link next to product in dropdown
- Procurement module calls: GET /api/products/{id}
- Product API returns full product details including units, costs, tax, attributes
- Procurement module displays product detail modal
- User reviews details, closes modal
- Resume at step 9

**Alt-201B: No Products Found** (At step 6)
- Search query returns zero matching products
- Product API returns empty array with 200 OK status
- Procurement module displays: "No products found matching '[term]'"
- User refines search term
- Resume at step 3

**Alt-201C: Price Exceeds Deviation** (At step 13)
- Price variance is 15% but product deviation limit is 10%
- Procurement module displays warning:
  - "Price variance (15%) exceeds allowed deviation (10%)"
  - "This purchase requires approval from Department Manager"
- User options:
  - Adjust price to within limit
  - Request approval override (sends notification)
  - Save as draft (pending approval)
- Resume at step 15 based on user choice

**Exception Flows**:

**Exc-201A: Product API Unavailable** (At step 4)
- Product API service is down or unreachable
- HTTP timeout (5 second) or connection refused
- Procurement module displays error: "Product service temporarily unavailable. Please try again."
- User can retry or contact support
- Process ends

**Exc-201B: Invalid Product Data** (At step 7)
- Product API returns data with missing required fields
- Procurement module detects validation failure
- Procurement module logs integration error
- Procurement module displays: "Invalid product data. Please contact support."
- User cannot proceed with this product
- Process ends

**Exc-201C: Concurrent Product Update** (Between steps 9 and 15)
- Product master data changed while user was entering PR/PO
- User's cached product data is now stale
- Procurement module detects version mismatch on save
- Procurement module displays: "Product data has changed. Please refresh."
- User clicks refresh to get latest data
- Resume at step 3

**API Contract**:

**Request**:
```json
GET /api/products/search?q=coffee&active=true&limit=10
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer {token}
  Content-Type: application/json
```

**Response**:

        "conversionRate": 5.00000
      },
      "standardCost": 250.00,
      "priceDeviation": 10.00,
      "quantityDeviation": 5.00,
      "isActive": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**Error Handling**:
- 200 OK: Success (even if 0 results)
- 400 Bad Request: Invalid query parameters
- 401 Unauthorized: Missing or invalid auth token
- 403 Forbidden: Insufficient permissions
- 404 Not Found: Product ID not found (detail lookup)
- 500 Internal Server Error: Server-side error
- 503 Service Unavailable: Service down

**Data Mapping**:

| Product Field | Procurement Field | Transformation |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| productCode | item_code | Direct mapping |
| englishDescription | item_description | Direct mapping |
| standardCost | unit_price | Default value (user can override) |
| priceDeviation | price_tolerance | Used in validation |
| quantityDeviation | quantity_tolerance | Used in validation |
| defaultOrderUnit | unit | Dropdown default selection |
| orderUnits[] | unit_options | Populate dropdown choices |

**Monitoring**:
- API call count per day
- Average response time
- Error rate by error type
- Cache hit rate (if caching implemented)

**Fallback Strategy**:
If Product API unavailable for extended period:
- Procurement module allows manual product code entry
- Validation disabled (manual override)
- Warning displayed about missing validation
- After service recovery, batch validation job checks historical entries

**Related Requirements**:
- FR-PROD-009: Price Deviation Control
- NFR-PROD-003: Search results within 1 second
- Integration with Procurement Module

### UC-PROD-202: Product Data for Inventory

**Description**: Inventory module retrieves product unit conversion data for inventory transactions, stock tracking, and threshold monitoring.

**Actor(s)**:
- **Primary**: Inventory Module
- **External System**: Product Module

**Trigger**: Inventory transaction (receipt, issue, adjustment, transfer)

**Integration Type**: REST API

**Direction**: Bidirectional (Inventory calls Product for data, Product queries Inventory for stock levels)

**Priority**: Critical

**Frequency**: Real-time (every inventory transaction)

**Preconditions**:
- Products exist with inventory unit defined
- Product assigned to store/location
- Inventory transaction being created/processed

**Postconditions**:
- **Success**: Unit conversions calculated correctly, inventory updated in base unit, stock levels compared to thresholds
- **Failure**: Transaction validation error, inventory not updated

**Main Flow**:
1. User creates Goods Receipt in Inventory module
2. User selects product and store/location
3. Inventory module calls Product API to get product data:
   - Endpoint: GET /api/products/{id}/inventory-data?storeId={storeId}
4. Product API returns:
   - Product ID, Code, Description
   - Inventory Unit (base unit) with ID, code, name
   - Order Units with conversion rates
   - Store assignment with min/max thresholds for selected store
5. Inventory module displays unit dropdown with all order units
6. User enters received quantity: 10
7. User selects unit: Box
8. Inventory module needs to convert to base unit (inventory unit)
9. Inventory module calls Product API for conversion:
   - Endpoint: POST /api/products/convert-unit
   - Body: {productId, fromUnit: "Box", toUnit: "Each", quantity: 10}
10. Product API retrieves conversion rate: 1 Box = 12 Each
11. Product API calculates: 10 Box × 12 = 120 Each
12. Product API returns: {convertedQuantity: 120.000, targetUnit: "Each"}
13. Inventory module records transaction with 120 Each in inventory unit
14. Inventory module calculates new stock level: Previous stock + 120 Each
15. Inventory module compares to thresholds:
    - New stock: 350 Each
    - Minimum threshold: 100 Each (from product store assignment)
    - Maximum threshold: 500 Each
16. Stock within thresholds, no alert triggered
17. Transaction saved successfully
18. Process completes

**Alternative Flows**:

**Alt-202A: Stock Below Minimum** (At step 15)
- New stock level is 80 Each
- Minimum threshold is 100 Each
- Inventory module triggers low stock alert
- Notification sent to procurement staff and store manager
- Alert displayed in dashboard
- Continue to step 17

**Alt-202B: Stock Above Maximum** (At step 15)
- New stock level is 550 Each
- Maximum threshold is 500 Each
- Inventory module triggers overstock warning
- Warning logged for review
- Dashboard shows overstock indicator
- Continue to step 17

**Alt-202C: Convert Between Non-Base Units** (At step 9)
- User wants to convert 5 Boxes to Cartons (both are order units)
- Inventory module calls: POST /api/products/convert-unit
  - Body: {productId, fromUnit: "Box", toUnit: "Carton", quantity: 5}
- Product API converts to base unit first: 5 Box × 12 = 60 Each
- Product API converts from base to target: 60 Each ÷ 24 = 2.5 Cartons
- Product API returns: {convertedQuantity: 2.500, targetUnit: "Carton"}
- Inventory module displays conversion result
- Continue to step 13

**Exception Flows**:

**Exc-202A: Product Not Assigned to Store** (At step 4)
- Product API finds product but no store assignment for requested store
- Product API returns error response:
  - Status: 400 Bad Request
  - Message: "Product [Code] is not assigned to store [Name]"
- Inventory module displays error to user
- User must assign product to store first or select different store
- Transaction cannot proceed
- Process ends

**Exc-202B: Unit Not Found** (At step 10)
- User selected unit that is not assigned to product
- Product API cannot find conversion rate
- Product API returns error response:
  - Status: 400 Bad Request
  - Message: "Unit 'Box' is not assigned to product [Code]"
- Inventory module displays error
- User must select valid unit from dropdown
- Process ends

**Exc-202C: Conversion Rate Zero or Missing** (At step 10)
- Product data has invalid conversion rate (0.00000 or null)
- Product API detects data integrity issue
- Product API logs error for admin investigation
- Product API returns error:
  - Status: 500 Internal Server Error

### Common Patterns

**Pattern: Form Submission with Validation**
1. User fills form fields
2. User clicks submit button
3. System validates client-side (immediate feedback)
4. System submits to server via API
5. Server validates again (security and business rules)
6. Server processes and saves data
7. Server responds with success or error
8. System displays result message to user
9. System updates UI with new data

**Pattern: List with Search and Pagination**
1. User navigates to list page
2. System loads first page (default 25 rows)
3. System displays rows with pagination controls
4. User types search term
5. System filters list (300ms debounce)
6. System displays filtered results
7. User clicks next page
8. System loads page 2 of filtered results
9. System updates display

**Pattern: Master-Detail Navigation**
1. User views list of master records
2. User clicks row to view details
3. System navigates to detail page
4. System loads full record data
5. System displays detail view
6. User clicks edit button
7. System enables edit mode
8. User modifies fields
9. User saves changes
10. System returns to detail view (read-only)

**Pattern: Soft Delete with Dependency Check**
1. User initiates delete action
2. System checks for dependencies across modules
3. If dependencies exist: display blocking error with details
4. If no dependencies: display confirmation dialog
5. User confirms deletion
6. System sets deleted_at timestamp and deleted_by user ID
7. System creates activity log entry
8. System displays success message
9. Deleted record excluded from active lists
