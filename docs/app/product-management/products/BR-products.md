## Overview

The Products sub-module serves as the central repository for all product information within the CARMEN hospitality ERP system. It provides comprehensive product master data management capabilities that are utilized across all operational modules including Procurement, Inventory Management, Recipe Management, Store Operations, Sales, and Finance.

Products represent items that can be purchased, stored, used in recipes, or sold directly. Each product is assigned to a category within the three-level hierarchy (Category → Subcategory → Item Group) and has defined units of measure for inventory tracking, ordering, and recipe usage. The module supports flexible product configuration including multi-unit conversions, store-specific assignments, pricing and cost tracking, tax handling, and comprehensive activity logging.

This sub-module is critical for maintaining data consistency across the ERP system and enabling efficient product operations throughout the supply chain from procurement through to sale or consumption.

## Business Objectives

1. **Centralize Product Data**: Maintain a single source of truth for all product information accessible by all ERP modules to ensure consistency and eliminate data duplication
2. **Streamline Product Operations**: Enable efficient product creation, modification, and management with intuitive interfaces and bulk operation support
3. **Support Multi-Unit Operations**: Provide flexible unit conversion capabilities for inventory tracking (base unit), ordering (purchase unit), and recipe management (recipe unit)
4. **Enable Store-Specific Management**: Allow product assignment to multiple locations with store-specific min/max inventory thresholds for decentralized operations
5. **Track Product History**: Maintain comprehensive purchase history (latest orders and receipts) and complete activity logs for audit trails and analysis
6. **Facilitate Cost Management**: Track standard costs, receiving costs, and price deviations to support financial planning and procurement decisions
7. **Support Tax Compliance**: Manage product-specific tax types and rates to ensure accurate tax calculations across all transactions
8. **Enable Product Classification**: Support flexible categorization, product types (recipe/sale flags), and custom attributes for diverse product portfolio
9. **Provide Search and Discovery**: Offer powerful search, filtering, and sorting capabilities to quickly locate products from large catalogs (1000+ items)
10. **Integrate Seamlessly**: Provide robust integration points with Procurement, Inventory, Recipe, Sales, and Finance modules for end-to-end operations

## Key Stakeholders

- **Primary Users**: Procurement staff, inventory managers, product managers (daily product management, purchasing, receiving operations)
- **Secondary Users**: Store/location managers (viewing assigned products, checking inventory thresholds), recipe planners (product usage in recipes)
- **Approvers**: Department managers (approving product changes affecting costs or operations), finance managers (reviewing cost and pricing data)
- **Administrators**: System administrators (managing product master data, bulk imports/updates, system configuration)
- **Reviewers**: Finance team (auditing cost and price changes), operations managers (monitoring product performance and availability)
- **Support**: IT support team (troubleshooting product data issues, assisting with integrations)

- **BR-PROD-002**: Product English Description is mandatory (max 255 characters). Local Description is optional (max 255 characters) for multilingual support but recommended for hospitality operations.

- **BR-PROD-003**: Products can be Active or Inactive. Only Active products appear in operational transaction entry screens (PO, GRN, recipes, sales). Inactive products remain visible in historical records and reports. Default status is Active upon creation.

- **BR-PROD-004**: Every product must be assigned to exactly one category at each level of the three-level hierarchy (Category, Subcategory, Item Group). Category assignment is mandatory and cannot be null.

- **BR-PROD-005**: Products must have exactly one Inventory Unit (base unit) designated for stock tracking. All other units (Order, Recipe) are converted to/from this base unit. Inventory Unit cannot be changed if product has transaction history.

- **BR-PROD-006**: Products with dependencies cannot be deleted (soft or hard). Dependencies include: active purchase orders, inventory transactions in current fiscal period, active recipes using product as ingredient, open sales orders. System must display specific dependency counts to user.

### Data Validation Rules

- **BR-PROD-007**: Product codes must be unique across all products (active and soft-deleted). Format: alphanumeric with optional hyphens/underscores, max 50 characters, leading/trailing whitespace trimmed.

- **BR-PROD-008**: Price Deviation percentage must be 0-100%, stored as decimal (e.g., 10.50% stored as 0.1050). Products inherit deviation from Item Group but can override with product-specific value.

- **BR-PROD-009**: Quantity Deviation percentage must be 0-100%, stored as decimal. Products inherit deviation from Item Group but can override with product-specific value.

- **BR-PROD-010**: Category assignment at all three levels (Category, Subcategory, Item Group) is mandatory. System validates that Subcategory belongs to selected Category and Item Group belongs to selected Subcategory.

- **BR-PROD-011**: Inventory Unit (base unit) is mandatory and must be from active units master data. Conversion rate for inventory unit is always 1.00000 (by definition of base unit).

- **BR-PROD-012**: Order Units are optional. Multiple order units can be assigned with unique conversion rates to inventory unit. Conversion rates must be positive non-zero values with max 5 decimal precision.

- **BR-PROD-013**: Recipe Units are optional. Multiple recipe units can be assigned with unique conversion rates to inventory unit. Conversion rates must be positive non-zero values with max 5 decimal precision.

### Workflow Rules

- **BR-PROD-016**: Standard Cost and Last Receiving Cost are stored in system base currency only. Multi-currency costs handled at transaction level (PO, GRN) with exchange rate conversions.

- **BR-PROD-017**: Tax Type determines tax calculation method: "Added Tax" calculates tax on top of price (price + tax), "Included Tax" assumes tax is embedded in price (price with tax broken out), "None" means no tax applies. Tax Rate required for Added and Included types.

- **BR-PROD-018**: Soft deleted products retain all data with deleted_at timestamp and deleted_by user ID. Soft deleted products excluded from active lists and operational dropdowns but visible in historical reports with deleted indicator.

- **BR-PROD-019**: Product type flags ("Used in Recipes", "Sold Directly") are independent and can both be enabled, both disabled, or one of each. Products with neither flag are inventory/stock-only items.

### Calculation Rules

- **BR-PROD-020**: Deviation Validation Formula:
  - Price Deviation Check: `|Actual Price - Standard Cost| / Standard Cost * 100 <= Price Deviation %`
  - Quantity Deviation Check: `|Actual Quantity - Expected Quantity| / Expected Quantity * 100 <= Quantity Deviation %`
  - Transactions exceeding deviation require approval or blocking based on configuration

- **BR-PROD-021**: Unit Conversion Calculations:
  - To Base Unit: `Base Quantity = Order Quantity × Order Unit Conversion Rate` (rounded to 3 decimals)
  - From Base Unit: `Order Quantity = Base Quantity ÷ Order Unit Conversion Rate` (rounded to 3 decimals)
  - Between Non-Base Units: Convert to base then to target: `Quantity₂ = (Quantity₁ × Rate₁) ÷ Rate₂` (rounded to 3 decimals)
  - All intermediate calculations rounded before use in subsequent calculations

### Security Rules

## Integration Points

### Internal Integrations

- **Categories Module**: Products depend on three-level category hierarchy for classification. Category changes may impact multiple products inheriting deviation limits.

- **Units Module**: Products reference units master data for inventory, order, and recipe units. Unit changes may impact products using those units.

- **Procurement Module**: Products are selected in Purchase Requests and Purchase Orders. Cost and unit data flows from products to procurement transactions.

- **Goods Receipt (GRN) Module**: GRN transactions update product Last Receiving Cost and create purchase history records.

- **Inventory Management Module**: Products are central to all inventory transactions (receipts, issues, adjustments, transfers). Inventory Unit is base unit for stock tracking.

- **Recipe Management Module**: Products flagged as "Used in Recipes" are available as ingredients. Recipe Units with conversion rates support recipe calculations.

- **Store Operations Module**: Products assigned to stores with min/max thresholds support store requisitions and stock level monitoring.

- **Sales Module**: Products flagged as "Sold Directly" are available for sales orders and POS transactions.

- **Finance Module**: Product cost data (Standard Cost, Last Receiving Cost) integrates with cost accounting and financial reporting. Tax configuration flows to invoicing.

- **Vendor Management Module**: Purchase history links products to vendors for supplier analysis and negotiations.

### External Integrations

## Dependencies

### Module Dependencies

- **Categories Module**: Required for three-level product classification. Products cannot be created without valid category hierarchy.

- **Units Module**: Required for product unit definitions. Products must have inventory unit and optionally order/recipe units.

- **Users Module**: Required for authentication, authorization, and audit trail (created_by, updated_by fields).

- **Stores Module**: Required for store/location assignments and inventory thresholds.

### Technical Dependencies

- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+ for robust ACID transactions, foreign key constraints, and full-text search capabilities.

- **Authentication Service**: User authentication and authorization system for role-based access control.

- **Audit Logging Service**: Centralized logging service for product activity tracking.

### Data Dependencies

- **Category Master Data**: Three-level category hierarchy must exist before products can be assigned.

- **Unit Master Data**: Units must be defined before products can reference them for inventory/order/recipe purposes.

- **Store Master Data**: Stores/locations must exist before products can be assigned with inventory thresholds.

- **User Master Data**: Users must exist for audit trail and activity logging.

---

## Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions

- Products are uniquely identified by product code which remains immutable after creation for referential integrity.

- All product costs and prices are maintained in system base currency with currency conversion handled at transaction level.

- Product categorization follows strict three-level hierarchy with each level mandatory for complete classification.

- Inventory unit (base unit) is the fundamental unit for all stock tracking with all other units converted to/from it.

- Product master data changes are infrequent (weekly) compared to transaction volume (daily), so real-time synchronization overhead is acceptable.

- Users have basic computer literacy and can navigate web-based forms, dropdowns, and tables.

### Constraints

- Product codes limited to 50 characters due to UI display constraints and database index size limits.

- Description fields limited to 255 characters for English and local descriptions based on UI layout and typical usage patterns.

- Maximum 100 order units and 100 recipe units per product to prevent UI performance degradation.

- Maximum 50 store assignments per product as products are typically available in subset of locations.

- Conversion rates limited to 5 decimal precision balancing accuracy with storage efficiency.

- Activity log retention is indefinite (no automatic purging) which may impact long-term database size.

### Risks

- **Risk**: Product code uniqueness enforcement may cause issues during data migration if legacy systems have duplicate codes.
  - **Mitigation**: Provide data quality pre-check tool and bulk code reassignment utility during migration.

- **Risk**: Performance degradation with very large product catalogs (> 50,000 products) due to full-text search and complex joins.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement database indexing optimization, query caching, and pagination. Monitor query performance metrics.

- **Risk**: User resistance to change from existing manual/spreadsheet-based product management processes.
  - **Mitigation**: Conduct comprehensive user training, provide quick reference guides, and ensure system is more efficient than legacy process.

- **Risk**: Data quality issues during initial data migration may require significant cleanup effort.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement data validation tools, provide migration staging environment for testing, and allocate dedicated time for data cleansing.

- **Risk**: Integration complexity with multiple dependent modules (procurement, inventory, recipes) may cause implementation delays.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement phased rollout starting with standalone product master, then add integrations incrementally.

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Enhancements

- **Product Images**: Support upload and display of product images for better visual identification in UI and on shelf labels.

- **Multiple Barcodes**: Support primary and alternate barcodes per product for products sold in different package sizes.

- **Product Variants**: Support product variants (size, color, flavor) with shared master data and variant-specific attributes.

- **Pricing Module Integration**: Integrate with dedicated pricing module for customer-specific price lists, contracts, and promotions.

- **Supplier Catalog Integration**: Sync product data with supplier catalogs for automated product updates and new product discovery.

### Future Considerations

- **Forecasting Integration**: Integrate product data with demand forecasting module for automated reorder point calculations.

- **Quality Management**: Add quality control attributes (inspection requirements, quality grades, defect tracking).

- **Sustainability Metrics**: Track environmental impact data (carbon footprint, packaging materials, recyclability).

- **Product Lifecycle Management**: Track product status through lifecycle stages (development, active, phase-out, discontinued).

- **Compliance Management**: Track regulatory compliance (certifications, allergen information, nutritional data) for food safety.

- **Multi-language Support**: Extend description fields to support unlimited languages with user-selectable display language.

- **Product Bundling**: Support bundle/kit products composed of multiple component products for hospitality packages.
