## Overview

This document describes all use cases for the Unit Management sub-module within the Carmen ERP system. Use cases cover unit catalog management including viewing, searching, creating, editing, and deleting measurement units used throughout the hospitality operation. The module supports three unit types: INVENTORY (for stock tracking), ORDER (for purchasing), and RECIPE (for food preparation).
