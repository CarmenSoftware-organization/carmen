## Overview

The Unit Management sub-module provides a centralized system for managing all measurement units used throughout the Carmen ERP system. Units are fundamental to inventory management, purchasing, recipe management, and product specifications in hospitality operations. This module enables hotel staff to maintain a standardized catalog of measurement units across three distinct categories: inventory units (for stock tracking), order units (for procurement), and recipe units (for food preparation).

The system supports different types of measurement units required in hotel operations, from weight measurements (kilograms, grams) for kitchen inventory to volume measurements (liters, milliliters) for beverages, and specialized recipe measurements (teaspoons, tablespoons, cups) for food preparation. Each unit can be independently managed with full lifecycle control including creation, modification, activation/deactivation, and deletion.

This sub-module serves as the foundation for unit conversions in the Product Management module and ensures consistency in measurements across procurement, inventory, and operational planning workflows throughout the hotel enterprise.

## Business Objectives

1. **Standardize Measurements**: Establish a single source of truth for all measurement units used across kitchen, housekeeping, and maintenance departments to eliminate confusion and errors in ordering and inventory management.

2. **Support Multiple Unit Types**: Enable differentiation between inventory units (stock counting), order units (purchasing), and recipe units (food preparation) to accommodate different operational contexts in hospitality.

3. **Ensure Data Integrity**: Prevent deletion or modification of units that are actively used in products, recipes, or transactions, protecting critical business data from accidental corruption.

4. **Facilitate Unit Conversions**: Provide the base unit catalog that enables automatic conversions between different measurement systems (metric/imperial) in product and recipe management.

5. **Enable Operational Flexibility**: Allow authorized staff to add custom units specific to hotel operations while maintaining standard units required for reporting and compliance.

6. **Improve Search Efficiency**: Enable quick lookup of units through search and filtering capabilities, reducing time spent by purchasing staff, chefs, and storekeepers when creating orders or recipes.

7. **Support Audit Compliance**: Maintain complete audit trail of unit changes including creation dates, modification history, and active status for regulatory compliance in food service operations.

## Key Stakeholders

- **Primary Users**: Purchasing Manager, Head Chef, Storekeeper (manage and maintain unit catalog)
- **Secondary Users**: Sous Chef, Receiving Clerk, Kitchen Staff (reference units when creating recipes or processing deliveries)
- **Administrators**: System Administrator, IT Manager (configure system-wide unit settings and permissions)
- **Approvers**: General Manager, Financial Controller (approve addition of custom units)
- **Reviewers**: Internal Auditor, Quality Manager (audit unit usage and compliance)
- **Support**: IT Support Team (troubleshoot unit-related issues)

## Data Model

**Note**: The interfaces shown below are **conceptual data models** used to communicate business requirements. They are NOT intended to be copied directly into code. Developers should use these as a guide to understand the required data structure and then implement using appropriate technologies and patterns for the technical stack.

### Unit Entity

**Purpose**: Represents a measurement unit used throughout the system for products, inventory, orders, and recipes.

**Conceptual Structure**:

```typescript
interface Unit {
  // Primary key
  id: string;                     // Unique identifier (UUID format)

  // Core identification fields
  code: string;                   // Unit code (e.g., KG, ML, BOX) - unique, immutable
  name: string;                   // Full unit name (e.g., Kilogram, Milliliter)
  description?: string;           // Optional detailed description of the unit

  // Classification
  type: UnitType;                 // INVENTORY | ORDER | RECIPE

  // Status and state
  isActive: boolean;              // Active (true) or Inactive (false)

  // Audit fields
  createdAt: Date;                // Creation timestamp
  createdBy: string;              // User ID who created the unit
  updatedAt: Date;                // Last modification timestamp
  updatedBy: string;              // User ID who last modified the unit
}

// Unit type enumeration
type UnitType = 'INVENTORY' | 'ORDER' | 'RECIPE';
```

**Key Fields Explanation**:

- **code**: Immutable unique identifier used throughout the system for unit references. Must be memorable and standardized (e.g., KG, LB, L, GAL).
- **type**: Categorizes units based on their primary usage context in hospitality operations:
  - INVENTORY: Units for stock tracking (KG, L, PC)
  - ORDER: Units for purchasing and receiving (BOX, CASE, CTN, PLT)
  - RECIPE: Units for food preparation (TSP, TBSP, CUP, OZ)
- **isActive**: Controls whether unit can be selected for new products/recipes while preserving existing references.

### Unit Usage Statistics (Read-Only View)

**Purpose**: Provides usage analytics for units to prevent accidental deletion and inform management decisions.

**Conceptual Structure**:

```typescript
interface UnitUsageStats {
  unitId: string;                 // Reference to unit
  unitCode: string;               // Unit code for display
  unitName: string;               // Unit name for display

  // Usage counts
  productCount: number;           // Number of products using this unit
  recipeCount: number;            // Number of recipes using this unit
  activeTransactionCount: number; // Number of active transactions using this unit

  // Recent usage
  lastUsedDate?: Date;            // Most recent usage in any transaction
  lastUsedContext: string;        // Context of last usage (Product, Recipe, Transaction)

  // Computed flags
  canBeDeleted: boolean;          // True if all usage counts are zero
  deletionBlockedReason?: string; // Explanation if canBeDeleted is false
}
```

## Integration Points

### Internal System Integration

#### Product Management Integration
- **Purpose**: Units are selected as base units, purchase units, and stock units for products
- **Data Flow**: Product → Unit (read-only reference)
- **Validation**: Products can only use active units; inactive units can still display in existing products
- **Dependency**: Deleting a unit requires checking product_units table

#### Recipe Management Integration
- **Purpose**: Recipe units (TSP, TBSP, CUP) are used for ingredient measurements in recipes
- **Data Flow**: Recipe Ingredient → Unit (read-only reference)
- **Validation**: Recipe ingredients must use units of type RECIPE or INVENTORY
- **Dependency**: Deleting a unit requires checking recipe_ingredients table

#### Inventory Management Integration
- **Purpose**: Inventory transactions reference units for stock movements
- **Data Flow**: Inventory Transaction → Unit (read-only reference)
- **Validation**: Stock movements must use INVENTORY type units
- **Dependency**: Deleting a unit requires checking inventory_transactions table

#### Purchase Order Integration
- **Purpose**: Purchase order line items reference order units for quantity specification
- **Data Flow**: PO Line Item → Unit (read-only reference)
- **Validation**: Purchase orders can use INVENTORY or ORDER type units
- **Dependency**: Deleting a unit requires checking purchase_order_items table

### External System Integration

None. Unit Management is an internal master data module with no direct external system integrations.
