## Overview

The Product Categories sub-module provides a comprehensive hierarchical classification system for organizing products within the CARMEN hospitality ERP system. It implements a three-level taxonomy structure (Category → Subcategory → Item Group) that enables effective product organization, inventory management, purchasing workflows, and reporting across all hospitality operations.

The module supports drag-and-drop reorganization, flexible views (tree and list), and real-time search capabilities. Categories serve as the foundational organizational structure referenced by products, recipes, inventory reports, and purchasing workflows throughout the system.

Key capabilities include hierarchical category management (create, read, update, delete operations at all levels), visual tree navigation with expand/collapse functionality, drag-and-drop reordering for intuitive organization, and item count aggregation across the hierarchy. The system ensures referential integrity by preventing deletion of categories containing products while maintaining full audit trails of all category modifications.

## Business Objectives

1. **Organize Product Catalog**: Provide a logical, hierarchical structure for organizing thousands of SKUs across diverse product types (raw materials, finished goods, consumables, non-consumables) used in hospitality operations.

2. **Enable Effective Navigation**: Allow staff to quickly locate products through intuitive tree navigation and search, reducing time spent finding items during purchasing, inventory, and production workflows.

3. **Support Reporting and Analysis**: Enable category-based reporting for spend analysis, inventory valuation, purchasing patterns, and stock movement tracking across departments and cost centers.

4. **Standardize Classification**: Ensure consistent product categorization across all hotel properties and departments, enabling standardized reporting, benchmarking, and best practice sharing.

5. **Facilitate Purchase Planning**: Group related products for bulk purchasing, supplier negotiation, and inventory planning based on category-level demand patterns and lead times.

6. **Improve Data Quality**: Prevent orphaned products and ensure all items are properly classified through enforced category assignment and referential integrity rules.

7. **Enhance User Experience**: Provide intuitive drag-and-drop reorganization and visual hierarchy representation, making it easy for non-technical staff to manage complex taxonomies.

8. **Enable Flexible Organization**: Support multiple organizational perspectives (by product type, by department usage, by supplier, by storage location) through flexible subcategory and item group structures.

## Key Stakeholders

- **Primary Users**: Purchasing Managers (daily product categorization and organization), Inventory Managers (category-based reporting and stock analysis)
- **Secondary Users**: Head Chef (recipe ingredient categorization), Department Managers (category-based budgeting and procurement), Finance Team (category-based spend analysis)
- **Administrators**: System Administrators (category structure design, hierarchy maintenance, data cleanup), Product Management Team (category strategy and taxonomy governance)
- **Support**: IT Support Team (technical issues, data imports, system configuration)

## Functional Requirements

### FR-CAT-001: Three-Level Category Hierarchy
**Priority**: Critical

The system must support a three-level hierarchical product classification structure consisting of:
- **Level 1 - Category**: Top-level classification (e.g., "Raw Materials", "Beverages", "Consumables")
- **Level 2 - Subcategory**: Mid-level classification nested under categories (e.g., "Coffee Beans" under "Raw Materials")
- **Level 3 - Item Group**: Finest-level classification nested under subcategories (e.g., "Arabica" under "Coffee Beans")

Each level must support unlimited entries with parent-child relationships enforced through foreign keys. The hierarchy must allow flexible depth (categories with or without subcategories, subcategories with or without item groups) to accommodate different organizational needs.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System creates category records with null parent_id (root level)
- System creates subcategory records with category_id as parent_id (level 2)
- System creates item group records with subcategory_id as parent_id (level 3)
- System prevents creating more than 3 levels deep (no children of item groups)
- Each product must be assigned to exactly one category at any level (category, subcategory, or item group)
- System displays hierarchy visually with proper indentation and expansion controls

## Business Rules

### General Rules
- **BR-CAT-001**: **Hierarchy Depth Limit** - The category hierarchy must not exceed 3 levels (Category → Subcategory → Item Group). Item groups cannot have children. This limit ensures manageable complexity and optimal performance.

- **BR-CAT-002**: **Category Naming Conventions** - Category names must be 1-100 characters, cannot contain special characters except space, hyphen, and ampersand, and must start and end with alphanumeric characters. Names should be descriptive and follow title case convention (e.g., "Coffee Beans", not "coffee beans" or "COFFEE BEANS").

- **BR-CAT-003**: **Category Type Assignment** - Each category entry must be explicitly typed as CATEGORY (level 1), SUBCATEGORY (level 2), or ITEM_GROUP (level 3). Type determines allowed operations and relationships.

### Data Validation Rules
- **BR-CAT-004**: **Unique Names Within Parent** - Category names must be unique among siblings (same parent level) but can be reused across different parents. For example, two subcategories under different categories can both be named "Organic", but two subcategories under the same category cannot share the name.

- **BR-CAT-005**: **Parent-Child Level Restrictions** - A CATEGORY can only have SUBCATEGORY children. A SUBCATEGORY can only have ITEM_GROUP children. An ITEM_GROUP cannot have any children. These restrictions enforce the three-level hierarchy limit.

- **BR-CAT-006**: **Circular Reference Prevention** - A category cannot be its own parent or ancestor. When moving categories in the hierarchy, the system must validate that the new parent is not a descendant of the category being moved.

- **BR-CAT-007**: **Cascade Deletion Rules** - When deleting a category with children, the system must either: (1) prevent deletion and warn user that category has children, or (2) cascade delete all children after explicit user confirmation with count of affected items. Products assigned to deleted categories must be re-assigned or flagged for attention.

### Workflow Rules
- **BR-CAT-008**: **Sort Order Management** - Categories at the same level under the same parent are ordered by a numerical sort_order field. When a category is deleted, remaining siblings must be re-sequenced to eliminate gaps (e.g., if items have order 0, 1, 2, 3 and item at position 1 is deleted, remaining items are renumbered to 0, 1, 2).

- **BR-CAT-009**: **Active Status Default** - Newly created categories default to active status (is_active = true). Users must explicitly deactivate categories that should not appear in dropdown selections.

- **BR-CAT-010**: **Product Assignment Requirement** - Every product in the system must be assigned to exactly one category (at any level - category, subcategory, or item group). Products cannot exist without a category assignment. Products can be re-assigned to different categories but cannot be assigned to multiple categories simultaneously.

- **BR-CAT-011**: **Deletion Prevention with Products** - Categories, subcategories, or item groups that have products directly assigned to them cannot be deleted. Users must first re-assign all products to different categories before deletion is allowed. This rule prevents orphaned products.

### Calculation Rules
- **BR-CAT-012**: **Item Count Aggregation** - The displayed item count for each category level includes both direct products and all products in descendant categories. Formula: `total_count = direct_products + sum(children_total_count)`. This recursive calculation must update in real-time when products are added, removed, or reassigned.

- **BR-CAT-013**: **Hierarchy Path Construction** - The full path from root to any category node is constructed by traversing parent relationships upward. Path format: "Level1 > Level2 > Level3" (e.g., "Raw Materials > Coffee Beans > Arabica"). Maximum path length is limited by three-level hierarchy.

### Security Rules
- **BR-CAT-014**: **Role-Based Creation Access** - Only users with roles "Product Manager" or "System Administrator" can create new categories. Regular staff and department managers have read-only access to category structures.

- **BR-CAT-015**: **Role-Based Modification Access** - Only users with roles "Product Manager" or "System Administrator" can modify category names, descriptions, or hierarchy relationships. Edit operations require explicit permission checks before and after submission.

- **BR-CAT-016**: **Role-Based Deletion Access** - Only users with role "System Administrator" can delete categories. Product Managers can deactivate but not delete. This restriction protects system integrity by limiting destructive operations to highest privilege level.

- **BR-CAT-017**: **Audit Trail Requirements** - All category operations (create, update, delete, reorder) must record: user ID, timestamp, operation type, affected category ID, previous values (for updates), and IP address. Audit logs must be immutable and retained for minimum 7 years for compliance.

- **BR-CAT-018**: **Soft Delete Implementation** - Categories are never physically deleted from the database. Deletion sets a `deleted_at` timestamp and `deleted_by` user ID. Soft-deleted categories are excluded from active queries but preserved for historical data integrity and audit purposes.

## Data Model

**Note**: The interfaces shown below are **conceptual data models** used to communicate business requirements. They are NOT intended to be copied directly into code. Developers should use these as a guide to understand the required data structure and then implement using appropriate technologies and patterns for the technical stack.

### Category Entity

**Purpose**: Represents a node in the three-level product classification hierarchy. Can be a top-level category, subcategory, or item group depending on its type and parent relationship.

**Conceptual Structure**:

```typescript
interface Category {
  // Primary key
  id: string;                          // UUID, unique identifier

  // Core fields
  name: string;                        // Display name (1-100 chars, required)
  description: string;                 // Detailed description (0-500 chars, optional)
  type: CategoryType;                  // CATEGORY | SUBCATEGORY | ITEM_GROUP

  // Hierarchy relationships
  parentId: string | null;             // Parent category ID (null for root level)
  parent?: Category;                   // Navigation property to parent
  children: Category[];                // Child categories/subcategories/item groups

  // Ordering and display
  sortOrder: number;                   // Position among siblings (0-based)
  level: number;                       // Hierarchy depth (1, 2, or 3)
  path: string;                        // Full hierarchy path (computed)

  // Product relationships
  products: Product[];                 // Products directly assigned to this category
  itemCount: number;                   // Direct product count (computed)
  totalItemCount: number;              // Direct + nested product count (computed)

  // Status and visibility
  isActive: boolean;                   // Active status (default: true)

  // Audit fields
  createdAt: Date;                     // Creation timestamp
  createdBy: string;                   // Creator user ID
  updatedAt: Date;                     // Last update timestamp
  updatedBy: string;                   // Last updater user ID
  deletedAt: Date | null;              // Soft delete timestamp (null if active)
  deletedBy: string | null;            // User who deleted (null if active)
}

// Enum for category types
type CategoryType = 'CATEGORY' | 'SUBCATEGORY' | 'ITEM_GROUP';
```

### Product Entity (Referenced)

**Purpose**: Products are assigned to categories for organizational purposes. This is a simplified view showing only category-related fields.

```typescript
interface Product {
  id: string;                          // Product UUID
  sku: string;                         // Stock keeping unit code
  name: string;                        // Product name

  // Category relationship
  categoryId: string;                  // Foreign key to Category
  category?: Category;                 // Navigation property

  // Other product fields...
  // (full Product interface defined in Product sub-module documentation)
}
```

---

## Integration Points

### Internal Integrations

- **Product Management - Products Sub-module**: Categories provide the organizational structure for products. Every product must reference a category (category_id foreign key). Products query categories for dropdown selections during creation/editing. Category deletion is blocked if products reference it. Item counts are calculated by querying product assignments.

- **Product Management - Units Sub-module**: No direct integration. Categories and units are independent classification systems (categories for product grouping, units for measurement). However, reporting may combine both dimensions (e.g., "Total inventory value by category and unit type").

- **Inventory Management**: Inventory reports aggregate stock levels and valuations by category. Categories enable reporting queries like "Total inventory value by category", "Stock movement by subcategory", "Low stock alerts by item group". Inventory transactions may be filtered and grouped by product category for analysis.

- **Procurement Module**: Purchase requests and purchase orders can be filtered and grouped by product category. Category-based purchasing enables bulk procurement ("Order all items in Coffee Beans category"), supplier category assignments ("Supplier X provides all Beverage categories"), and category-level budget tracking.

- **Recipe Management**: Recipes may categorize ingredients by product category for costing, inventory planning, and nutritional analysis. Category-based recipe reports enable insights like "Recipe costs by ingredient category", "Recipes using Raw Materials category".

- **Reporting and Analytics**: Categories serve as a primary dimension for all reporting and analytics. Standard reports include: spend by category, inventory valuation by category, product movement by category, supplier performance by category, budget vs actual by category.

### External Integrations

- **None**: Categories are an internal organizational structure with no direct external system integrations. However, category data may be exported to external systems (accounting software, BI tools) as a classification dimension for reporting and analysis.

### Data Dependencies

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **NFR-CAT-001**: **Category List Load Time** - The category list page (tree or list view) must load completely in under 2 seconds with up to 1,000 category entries on a standard 4G connection. Response includes full hierarchy structure, item counts, and initial render.

- **NFR-CAT-002**: **Search Response Time** - Category search must return results within 300ms of the last keystroke for up to 1,000 categories. Debouncing should prevent excessive queries while typing. Search must work efficiently without backend round trips (client-side filtering preferred).

- **NFR-CAT-003**: **Drag-and-Drop Responsiveness** - Drag-and-drop operations must feel responsive with visual feedback appearing within 50ms of mouse/touch interaction. Drop operations (save to database) must complete within 500ms. If save fails, item must revert to original position within 200ms.

- **NFR-CAT-004**: **Item Count Calculation Performance** - Item counts (direct + nested) must be calculated and displayed without perceivable delay (< 200ms). For large hierarchies (100+ categories with 10,000+ products), counts may be pre-calculated and cached, updating asynchronously when products added/removed.

- **NFR-CAT-005**: **Concurrent User Support** - The system must support at least 20 concurrent users viewing and managing categories without performance degradation. Database queries must be optimized with proper indexing on parent_id, type, is_active, and sort_order fields.

### Security
- **NFR-CAT-006**: **Authentication Requirement** - All category management pages and API endpoints must require valid user authentication. Unauthenticated requests must redirect to login page or return 401 Unauthorized.

- **NFR-CAT-007**: **Authorization Enforcement** - All category operations (create, update, delete, reorder) must verify user permissions both in UI (hide unauthorized controls) and on server (reject unauthorized requests with 403 Forbidden). Permission checks must occur before and after form submission.

- **NFR-CAT-008**: **Input Sanitization** - All user input (category names, descriptions) must be sanitized to prevent XSS attacks, SQL injection, and HTML injection. Server-side validation must strip or escape dangerous characters before database storage.

- **NFR-CAT-009**: **Audit Logging** - All category operations must be logged to an immutable audit table including: user ID, timestamp, IP address, operation type (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, REORDER), affected category ID, and changed fields with previous and new values. Audit logs must be retained for minimum 7 years.

- **NFR-CAT-010**: **Session Security** - Category management sessions must timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity. Unsaved changes must be preserved in browser storage and restored when user re-authenticates. Sensitive category data must not be cached in browser after logout.

### Usability
- **NFR-CAT-011**: **Intuitive Navigation** - The category hierarchy must be navigable with zero training for users familiar with standard file explorer interfaces. Expand/collapse, drag-and-drop, and breadcrumb navigation must follow common UX patterns.

- **NFR-CAT-012**: **Mobile Usability** - All category management features must be fully functional on mobile devices (phone and tablet) with touch-optimized controls. Minimum tap target size is 44x44 pixels. No horizontal scrolling should be required.

- **NFR-CAT-013**: **Error Message Clarity** - All validation errors and operation failures must display clear, actionable messages explaining what went wrong and how to fix it. Avoid technical jargon in user-facing messages.

- **NFR-CAT-014**: **Keyboard Accessibility** - All category management functions must be accessible via keyboard (no mouse required). Tab navigation, enter to select, arrow keys for tree navigation, and keyboard shortcuts for common actions (N for new, E for edit, Delete for delete).

### Maintainability
- **NFR-CAT-015**: **Code Organization** - Category management code must be organized following Next.js 14 App Router conventions with clear separation: pages (routing), components (UI), services (business logic), types (interfaces), and utils (helpers).

- **NFR-CAT-016**: **Documentation Standards** - All category-related code must include JSDoc comments explaining purpose, parameters, return values, and examples. Complex business logic must include inline comments explaining rationale.

- **NFR-CAT-017**: **Test Coverage** - Category management features must have minimum 80% unit test coverage and 70% integration test coverage. Critical paths (create, update, delete, reorder) must have 100% test coverage.

### Availability
- **NFR-CAT-018**: **Uptime Requirement** - The category management module must maintain 99.5% uptime during business hours (6 AM - 11 PM local time). Planned maintenance must be scheduled during off-peak hours with advance notice.

- **NFR-CAT-019**: **Error Recovery** - If category operations fail due to database errors, the system must gracefully handle failures without data corruption. Failed operations must be retryable, and partial updates must be rolled back transactionally.

### Scalability
- **NFR-CAT-020**: **Hierarchy Size Support** - The system must efficiently handle category hierarchies up to 1,000 total entries (categories + subcategories + item groups) without performance degradation. Queries must use indexed lookups to avoid full table scans.

- **NFR-CAT-021**: **Product Assignment Scalability** - Category item counts must scale to handle 100,000+ product assignments across the hierarchy. Count calculations must be optimized (pre-calculated or cached) to avoid performance issues with large product catalogs.

## Success Metrics

1. **User Adoption**: 90%+ of products assigned to 3-level deep categories (Category → Subcategory → Item Group) within 3 months of launch.

2. **Navigation Efficiency**: Average time to locate a category reduced by 50% compared to previous flat list approach (target: < 30 seconds to find any category).

3. **Data Quality**: 99%+ category assignment compliance (all products have valid category assignments, no orphaned products).

4. **Performance**: 95%+ of category operations complete within performance targets (2s page load, 300ms search, 500ms save).

5. **User Satisfaction**: 85%+ satisfaction score on category management UX (measured via user survey).

6. **System Stability**: < 5 category-related bugs reported per month after initial 3-month stabilization period.

7. **Mobile Usage**: 30%+ of category management operations performed on mobile devices within 6 months.

## Assumptions and Constraints

**Assumptions**:
- Users are familiar with hierarchical folder structures (similar to file explorers)
- Product catalog contains between 500 and 10,000 products requiring classification
- Maximum category depth of 3 levels is sufficient for all organizational needs
- Users have modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) within last 2 versions
- Internet connection speed is at least 4G/LTE or equivalent for acceptable performance
- Category reorganization happens infrequently (weekly or monthly, not daily)

**Constraints**:
- Next.js 14 App Router framework (using React Server Components and Server Actions)
- PostgreSQL database for data storage (via Supabase)
- Cannot exceed 3-level hierarchy depth due to performance and UX considerations
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing product category assignments
- Cannot delete categories with active product assignments (business rule constraint)
- Mobile experience must work on devices as small as 320px width (iPhone SE)
- Must support touch and mouse interactions equally well (no mouse-only features)

---

## Risks and Mitigation

**Risk 1**: Users may struggle with complex hierarchy organization if product catalog is large and categories are not well-defined.
- **Mitigation**: Provide clear guidance on category naming conventions and organization. Implement search and filter features to help users locate categories quickly. Consider providing pre-defined category templates for common hospitality operations.

**Risk 2**: Drag-and-drop functionality may not work well on all mobile devices or with assistive technologies.
- **Mitigation**: Provide alternative input methods (dropdown selectors, move buttons) for users who cannot use drag-and-drop. Ensure keyboard accessibility with arrow key navigation and enter to select.

**Risk 3**: Item count calculations may become slow with very large product catalogs (10,000+ products).
- **Mitigation**: Pre-calculate and cache item counts, updating asynchronously when products change. Use database triggers or background jobs to maintain count accuracy without impacting user-facing performance.

**Risk 4**: Users may accidentally delete important categories with many nested children.
- **Mitigation**: Implement cascade deletion with explicit confirmation showing count of affected items. Consider requiring admin approval for deletion of categories with > 50 products. Implement soft delete to allow recovery.

**Risk 5**: Category names may not be unique across different languages/locales if system expands internationally.
- **Mitigation**: Plan for future internationalization by designing data model to support locale-specific category names (category_translations table). Current implementation can use English names with notes field for translations.

**Phase 3 Enhancements** (12-24 months):
- **Multi-Language Support**: Translate category names and descriptions into multiple languages
- **Category Metadata**: Custom fields for categories (e.g., department, cost center, GL account, responsible manager)
- **Category Inheritance**: Inherit attributes from parent categories (e.g., all Coffee Bean subcategories inherit "Perishable" attribute)
- **Category Versioning**: Track history of category structure changes with ability to rollback
- **Category Approval Workflow**: Require approval for category creation/deletion in production environment
