- Token-based portal access and authentication
- Online price entry interface
- Excel template upload functionality
- Excel template download functionality
- Draft saving and auto-save
- Price submission workflow (draft → submitted)
- Submission confirmation and tracking

**Out of Scope (See Related Modules)**:
- Campaign creation and management → See [requests-for-pricing](../requests-for-pricing/)
- Pricelist template creation → See [pricelist-templates](../pricelist-templates/)
- Pricelist storage and management → See [price-lists](../price-lists/)
- Vendor directory and profiles → See [vendor-directory](../vendor-directory/)
- Campaign analytics and reporting → See [requests-for-pricing](../requests-for-pricing/)
