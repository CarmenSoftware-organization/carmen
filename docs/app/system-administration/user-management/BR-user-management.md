## Overview

The User Management module enables system administrators to create, configure, and manage user accounts across the Carmen ERP system. It provides comprehensive user lifecycle management including registration, role assignment, department allocation, and permission configuration.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- User list loads within 2 seconds for up to 10,000 users
- Search results return within 500ms
- Bulk operations complete within 30 seconds for up to 100 users
- System supports 500 concurrent user management sessions

### Security
- All password resets require email verification
- Failed login attempts trigger account lockout after 5 tries
- Sensitive user data encrypted at rest
- All user modifications logged for audit
- Role changes require dual authorization for critical roles

### Usability
- User creation wizard completes in maximum 3 steps
- Form validation provides real-time feedback
- Error messages are clear and actionable
- Mobile-responsive interface for user viewing

### Data Integrity
- Email uniqueness enforced at database level
- Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
- Soft delete preserves audit trail
- User IDs are immutable UUIDs

## Business Rules

### BR-001: Unique Email Requirement
Each user must have a unique email address across the entire system. Email serves as the primary identifier for authentication.

### BR-002: HOD Designation
A user can be designated as Head of Department (HOD) for one or more departments. HOD status grants automatic approval authority within that department.

### BR-003: Primary Role Requirement
Every user must have exactly one primary role. The primary role determines default permissions and primary workflow assignments.

### BR-004: Approval Limit Hierarchy
User-specific approval limits override role-based limits. If no user-specific limit is set, the primary role's limit applies.

### BR-005: Location-Based Access Control
Users can only view and manipulate data from their assigned locations. Multi-location access requires explicit location assignment.

### BR-006: Active Department Requirement
Users can only be assigned to active departments. Inactive department assignments are automatically suspended.

### BR-007: Invitation Expiry
User invitations expire after 7 days. Expired invitations must be resent to allow user registration.

### BR-008: Clearance Level Enforcement
Users cannot access resources with higher clearance requirements than their assigned clearance level.
