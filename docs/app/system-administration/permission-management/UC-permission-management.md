## UC-PM-001: Create New Role

### Basic Information
- **Actor**: System Administrator, General Manager
- **Goal**: Create a new role with specific permissions
- **Preconditions**:
  - User is authenticated with role creation permission
  - User has access to Permission Management module
- **Postconditions**:
  - New role is created and available for assignment
  - Role appears in role list
  - Audit log entry is created

### Main Flow
1. User navigates to Permission Management > Roles
2. System displays role list page
3. User clicks "Create Role" button
4. System displays role creation form with tabs:
   - **General**: Name, description, hierarchy
   - **Permissions**: Permission assignment interface
   - **Parent Roles**: Role inheritance configuration
5. User enters role information:
   - Role Name: "Restaurant Manager" (required)
   - Description: "Manages restaurant operations" (optional)
   - Hierarchy Level: Auto-calculated based on parent
6. User selects parent role (optional):
   - Searches for "Department Manager"
   - Selects parent role from dropdown
   - System displays parent's permissions for reference
7. User assigns permissions:
   - Uses permission search to find relevant permissions
   - Selects permissions from categorized list:
     - Procurement: purchase_request:create, purchase_request:approve_department
     - Inventory: inventory_item:view_stock, stock_count:view
     - Reporting: department_report:view
   - System shows inherited permissions from parent (read-only)
   - Total permissions: Direct (5) + Inherited (12) = 17
8. User reviews role summary:
   - Role name, hierarchy level, parent roles
   - Direct permissions count
   - Inherited permissions count
   - Effective permissions preview
9. User clicks "Create Role" button
10. System validates input:
    - Role name is unique
    - Permission format is valid
    - No circular inheritance
11. System creates role in data store
12. System logs role creation in audit trail
13. System displays success message: "Role 'Restaurant Manager' created successfully"
14. System returns to role list with new role highlighted

### Alternative Flows

  - User corrects permission
  - Flow continues from step 10

**AF-003: Circular Inheritance Detected**
- At step 10, if circular inheritance detected:
  - System displays error: "Circular inheritance detected. Role A cannot inherit from Role B if Role B inherits from Role A"

  - Flow continues from step 6

**AF-004: User Cancels Creation**
- At any step before step 10:
  - User clicks "Cancel" button
