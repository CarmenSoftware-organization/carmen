## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose
The Permission Management module provides centralized control over user access rights through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), with plans for future Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) capabilities. This system ensures secure, auditable access management aligned with hospitality industry requirements.

### 1.2 Current Implementation Status
- **Implemented**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with role hierarchy
- **In Development**: Policy management UI and ABAC engine
- **Planned**: Database schema implementation, advanced policy builder, subscription-based permissions

### 1.3 Key Capabilities
- **Role Management**: Create, edit, and manage 20+ hospitality-specific roles
- **Permission Assignment**: Granular resource:action permission model
- **Role Hierarchy**: Multi-level role inheritance for complex organizational structures
- **User Assignment**: Assign users to roles with department/location context
- **Audit Trail**: Track all permission changes and access attempts

---

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Access Control Models

#### Current: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```typescript
// Permission Format: resource:action
Examples:
  - "purchase_request:create"
  - "purchase_request:approve_department"
  - "purchase_order:*" // All actions on resource
  - "*" // All permissions (System Administrator only)
```

#### Planned: Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
Future enhancement to support complex conditional access based on:
- Subject attributes (user properties, department, location, clearance level)
- Resource attributes (document status, value, classification)
- Environment attributes (time, location, system state)
- Action attributes (read, write, approve, delete)

### 2.2 System Architecture
