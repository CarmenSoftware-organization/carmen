- System prevents status change
- User must fix errors before activation
- Flow returns to step 4

**E2: Cannot Deactivate Last Workflow**
- At step 8, system detects this is last active workflow of type
- System displays error:
  - "Cannot deactivate last workflow of type '{type}'"
  - "At least one active workflow required for each type"
  - "Please activate another workflow first"
- Status change is blocked
- Flow returns to step 4

**E3: Concurrent Status Change**
- At step 11, system detects another user changed status
- System displays error:
  - "Workflow status was changed by {user name}"
  - "Current status: {current status}"
  - "Your requested change: {requested status}"
  - Options: "Reload" or "Override"
- User chooses action
- If reload, system refreshes with current status
- If override (admin only), system proceeds with change

### Business Rules
- BR-WF-002: Workflows must meet activation requirements before activation
- At least one active workflow should exist per workflow type
- Status changes don't affect in-progress documents
- Only Draft and Inactive workflows can be deleted
- Deactivation is reversible (reactivation allowed)

### Data Requirements
- Current status: Read from database
- New status: Selected by user from enum
- Last modified timestamp: Auto-updated on status change
- Last modified by: Current user ID
- Audit log entry: Created with status change details

### UI Requirements
- Clear status badge with color coding:
  - Active: Green badge
  - Inactive: Gray badge
  - Draft: Yellow badge
- Status dropdown in edit mode
- Validation feedback before activation
- Confirmation dialogs for status changes
- Impact warnings (in-progress documents, last workflow)
- Success message after status change

## UC-WF-012: Clone Existing Workflow

### Description
Allows administrators to create a new workflow by cloning an existing one, speeding up configuration for similar workflows.

### Actors
- **Primary**: System Administrator
- **Secondary**: Super Administrator

### Preconditions
- User has "Create Workflows" permission
- Source workflow exists in the system
- User is authenticated

### Postconditions
- **Success**: New workflow created with cloned configuration
- **Failure**: Clone operation fails, error message displayed

### Main Flow
1. User views workflow detail page of source workflow
2. System displays workflow actions menu
3. User clicks "Clone Workflow" button
4. System displays clone configuration dialog:
   - New workflow name field (prefilled with "{Original Name} (Copy)")
   - Workflow type (same as source, read-only)
   - Description field (copied from source)
   - Clone options checkboxes:
     - Clone stages ✓ (checked by default)
     - Clone routing rules ✓ (checked by default)
     - Clone notifications ✓ (checked by default)
     - Clone user assignments ☐ (unchecked by default)
     - Clone product assignments ☐ (unchecked by default)
5. User modifies new workflow name
6. User selects clone options (keeps defaults or adjusts)
7. User clicks "Clone" button
8. System validates new workflow name is unique
9. System creates new workflow with:
   - New unique workflow ID (e.g., "WF-003")
   - Specified name
   - Draft status (always starts as draft)
   - Copied description
10. If "Clone stages" selected:
    - System copies all stages with same configuration
    - System generates new stage IDs
    - System maintains stage sequence
11. If "Clone routing rules" selected:
    - System copies all routing rules
    - System updates rule IDs
    - System maintains rule precedence
12. If "Clone notifications" selected:
    - System copies notification configurations
    - System copies linked templates
    - System generates new notification IDs
13. If "Clone user assignments" selected:
    - System copies user assignments to stages
    - System validates users are still active
    - Removes inactive users with warning
14. If "Clone product assignments" selected:
    - System copies product assignments
    - System validates products are still active
    - Removes inactive products with warning
15. System saves cloned workflow
16. System displays success message
17. System navigates to new workflow detail page
18. User can review and modify cloned workflow
19. User activates workflow when ready (see UC-WF-011)

### Alternative Flows

**A1: Minimal Clone (Stages Only)**
- At step 6, user unchecks all options except "Clone stages"
- System creates workflow with stages only
- User must manually configure:
  - Routing rules
  - Notifications
  - User assignments
  - Product assignments
- Flow continues from step 7

**A2: Quick Activate After Clone**
- At step 18, user immediately activates cloned workflow
- User clicks "Edit" then changes status to "Active"
- System performs activation validation
- If validation passes, workflow is activated
- Flow continues from step 19

**A3: Clone from Inactive Workflow**
- At step 1, source workflow is inactive
- Clone operation proceeds normally
- Cloned workflow starts as Draft regardless
- User can review and modify before activation
- Flow continues normally

**A4: Modify Name Before Clone**
- At step 5, user enters custom name instead of default
- User enters: "Enhanced Purchase Workflow"
- System uses custom name for new workflow
- Flow continues from step 7

### Exception Flows

**E1: Duplicate Workflow Name**
- At step 8, system detects duplicate name
- System displays error: "Workflow name already exists"
- System suggests alternative name: "{Name} (Copy 2)"
- User enters unique name
- Flow continues from step 7

**E2: Some Users Inactive**
- At step 13, system detects inactive users in assignments
- System displays warning:
  - "{count} assigned users are inactive"
  - Lists inactive users
  - "These users will be excluded from cloned workflow"
  - Options: "Proceed" or "Cancel"
- User chooses to proceed or cancel
- If proceed, inactive users are excluded
- Flow continues from step 14

**E3: All Products Inactive**
- At step 14, all assigned products are inactive
- System displays warning:
  - "All assigned products are inactive"
  - "Cloned workflow will have no product assignments"
  - Options: "Proceed" or "Cancel"
- User chooses to proceed or cancel
- If proceed, workflow created without products
- Flow continues from step 15

**E4: Clone Operation Fails**
- At step 15, database error during clone
- System logs error details
- System displays error: "Failed to clone workflow"
- System rolls back any partial changes
- User can retry clone operation
- Flow returns to step 1

### Business Rules
- Cloned workflows always start with Draft status
- New workflow gets unique system-generated ID
- User assignments and product assignments optional in clone
- Cloned workflow name must be unique
- Source workflow remains unchanged

### Data Requirements
- Source workflow ID: Required for cloning
- New workflow name: Required, unique, max 100 characters
- Clone options: Boolean flags for what to copy
- All source workflow data: Read for cloning

### UI Requirements
- Clear "Clone" button in workflow actions
- Clone configuration dialog with options
- Prefilled fields with source data
- Visual checklist for clone options
- Name validation feedback
- Warning messages for inactive users/products
- Success message with link to new workflow
- Progress indicator during clone operation
