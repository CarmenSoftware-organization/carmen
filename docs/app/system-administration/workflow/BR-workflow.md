## Overview

The Workflow Management module provides a comprehensive system for configuring and managing approval workflows for hospitality business processes. It enables administrators to define multi-stage approval workflows with dynamic routing, SLA management, user assignments, and automated notifications to streamline procurement and operational processes.

## Business Context

### Hospitality Industry Requirements

In hospitality operations, procurement and operational processes require structured approval workflows to ensure:
- **Financial Control**: Multi-level approvals based on monetary thresholds
- **Departmental Oversight**: Department-specific review and authorization
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated routing and SLA monitoring
- **Compliance**: Audit trails and role-based access control
- **Communication**: Automated notifications to stakeholders

### Problem Statement

Manual approval processes in hospitality environments face several challenges:
- Inconsistent approval routing leading to delays
- Lack of visibility into approval status and bottlenecks
- Difficulty managing SLAs and escalations
- Manual notification processes causing communication gaps
- Inflexible workflows that cannot adapt to business rule changes
- Limited audit trails for compliance and analysis

### Solution Objectives

The Workflow Management system aims to:
1. Provide flexible, configurable workflows for multiple document types
2. Enable dynamic routing based on business rules (e.g., amount thresholds)
3. Automate notifications and SLA monitoring
4. Support role-based assignments with department and location context
5. Maintain comprehensive audit trails for all workflow activities
6. Integrate with procurement and operational modules

## Functional Requirements

### FR-WF-001: Workflow Configuration

**Description**: System must allow administrators to create and configure approval workflows for different document types with multiple stages, routing rules, and notifications.

**Business Need**: Different business processes (purchase requests, store requisitions) require distinct approval workflows with varying complexity and approval hierarchies.

**Requirements**:
- Create workflows for different document types (Purchase Request, Store Requisition)
- Define unique workflow name (max 100 characters)
- Select workflow type from predefined list
- Specify document reference pattern with dynamic variables (e.g., "GP-{YYYY}-{00000}")
- Add description field for workflow purpose
- Set workflow status (Active, Inactive, Draft)
- Support multiple workflows for the same document type
- Prevent duplicate workflow names across the system

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Administrators can create new workflows via configuration interface
- ✅ Workflow names must be unique system-wide
- ✅ Only active workflows appear in document creation dropdowns
- ✅ Document reference pattern generates sequential numbers automatically
- ✅ Draft workflows can be saved and edited before activation
- ✅ System validates all required fields before saving

**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: User Management, Permission Management

### FR-WF-002: Workflow Stages

**Description**: System must support configurable multi-stage approval workflows with stage-specific settings for SLA, available actions, field visibility, user assignments, and role types.

**Business Need**: Approval processes require multiple stages with different approval authorities, timeframes, and visibility requirements. Each stage may have different users assigned based on their organizational role.

**Requirements**:
- Define unlimited workflow stages in sequential order
- Configure stage properties:
  - Stage name (max 100 characters)
  - Stage description
  - SLA duration and unit (hours/days)
  - Available actions (Submit, Approve, Reject, Send Back)
  - Field visibility rules (hide price fields if needed)
  - Role type (Requester, Purchaser, Approver, Reviewer)
- Assign users to each stage
- Support role-based stage assignments
- Allow empty user assignments for stages
- Configure field-level hiding per stage (price per unit, total price)
- Define "Completed" terminal stage
- Support stage reordering

**Stage Flow**:
1. Request Creation → 2. Purchasing Review → 3. Department Approval → 4. Finance Review → 5. Final Approval → 6. Completed

**Role Types**:
- **Requester**: Users who can create and submit requests
- **Purchaser**: Purchasing staff who review requests for accuracy
- **Approver**: Department heads or managers who approve requests
- **Reviewer**: Finance or senior management who provide final review

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Workflows support minimum 2 stages (creation + completion)
- ✅ Each stage has configurable SLA with visual indicators
- ✅ Available actions can be customized per stage
- ✅ Field visibility rules apply correctly at each stage
- ✅ Users can be assigned to stages via user assignment interface

- ✅ SLA countdown starts when document enters stage
- ✅ System validates stage configuration before activation

**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: User Management, Document Management

### FR-WF-003: Dynamic Routing Rules

**Description**: System must support conditional routing between stages based on document field values, enabling dynamic workflow paths that adapt to business rules.

**Business Need**: Approval requirements vary based on request characteristics (amount, category, urgency). Low-value requests should skip unnecessary approval stages, while high-value requests require additional approvals.

**Requirements**:
- Define routing rules with:
  - Rule name and description
  - Trigger stage (when to evaluate rule)
  - Condition field (document property to evaluate)
  - Operator (eq, lt, gt, lte, gte)
  - Value (threshold for comparison)
  - Action type (SKIP_STAGE, NEXT_STAGE)
  - Target stage (destination stage)
- Support multiple routing rules per workflow
- Evaluate rules in sequential order
- Support amount-based routing (common use case)
- Allow rules to skip stages or specify next stage
- Log all routing decisions for audit

**Example Routing Rules**:
- Amount ≤ 10,000 BAHT → Skip to Completed (bypass GM approval)
- Amount > 10,000 BAHT → Route to Final Approval
- Amount ≤ 5,000 BAHT → Skip to Completed (market list workflow)

**Operators**:
- `eq`: Equal to
- `lt`: Less than
- `gt`: Greater than
- `lte`: Less than or equal to
- `gte`: Greater than or equal to

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Routing rules can be added, edited, and removed
- ✅ Rules evaluate correctly based on document field values
- ✅ Multiple rules can exist for the same trigger stage
- ✅ First matching rule determines routing path
- ✅ Routing decisions are logged in audit trail
