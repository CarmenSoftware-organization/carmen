       "category": "main-course",
       "ingredients": [...],
       "steps": [...],
       "cost": {...},
       "pricing": {...}
     }
     ```
  5. System validates JSON structure
  6. System packages files (ZIP if multiple)
  7. System triggers download

#### A5: Export Filtered Recipe List
- **Trigger**: User exports recipes matching specific criteria
- **Flow**:
  1. User applies filters:
     - Category: Dessert
     - Cuisine: Italian
     - Status: Published
  2. System filters list (15 recipes match)
  3. User clicks "Export" → "CSV"
  4. System includes only filtered recipes
  5. System displays confirmation:
     - "Export 15 filtered recipes?"
     - "Current filters: Category=Dessert, Cuisine=Italian, Status=Published"
  6. User confirms
  7. System generates CSV with filtered data
  8. Filename includes filter info: Desserts-Italian-Published-[Date].csv

### Exception Flows

#### E1: Export with Missing Cost Permission
- **Trigger**: User lacks `recipe.cost.view` permission
- **Flow**:
  1. User attempts to export with cost data
  2. System detects missing permission
  3. System displays warning:
     - "You don't have permission to view cost data"
     - "Cost fields will be excluded from export"
  4. User can:
     - Continue without cost data
     - Cancel export
  5. If continue:
     - System exports without cost/pricing fields
     - Cost columns show "N/A" or omitted

#### E2: Large Export Timeout
- **Trigger**: Export of many recipes with images takes too long
- **Flow**:
  1. User selects 500 recipes with images
  2. User clicks "Export" → "Complete Package"
  3. System estimates export size and time:
     - Estimated size: 2.5 GB
     - Estimated time: 5-10 minutes
  4. System displays warning:
     - "Large export detected"
     - "This may take several minutes"
     - "Process in background?"
  5. User selects "Background processing"
  6. System queues export job
  7. System displays: "Export queued. You'll receive email when ready."
  8. User can continue working
  9. When complete, system:
     - Sends email with download link
     - Notifies user in app
     - Link valid for 48 hours

#### E3: Export Generation Failure
- **Trigger**: System error during export generation
- **Flow**:
  1. User initiates export
  2. System begins generation
  3. Error occurs (disk space, memory, corruption)
  4. System catches error
  5. System displays error message:
     - "Export failed"
     - "Error details: [technical message]"
     - "Please try again or contact support"
  6. System logs error for debugging
  7. User can retry or cancel

#### E4: No Recipes Match Export Criteria
- **Trigger**: User attempts to export but no recipes match filters
- **Flow**:
  1. User applies very restrictive filters
  2. User clicks "Export"
  3. System detects zero recipes matching
  4. System displays message:
     - "No recipes to export"
     - "Current filters return 0 results"
     - "Adjust filters or clear to export all"
  5. User adjusts filters or cancels

### Business Rules Applied
- Export only includes recipes user has permission to view
- Cost data only exported if user has `recipe.cost.view` permission
- Draft recipes only exported if user has `recipe.viewDraft` permission
- Export file naming follows convention: [Type]-[Filter]-[Date].[ext]
- Media assets only included if explicitly requested (bandwidth consideration)

### Performance Requirements
- PDF generation (single): < 3 seconds
- CSV generation (100 recipes): < 5 seconds
- JSON generation (100 recipes): < 5 seconds
- ZIP packaging (with images): < 30 seconds for 50 recipes
- Large exports (>100 recipes with images): Background job

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] "Export" button visible to authorized users
- [ ] Export options dialog displays all format choices
- [ ] PDF export generates print-optimized layout

- [ ] Large exports processed in background
- [ ] Email notification sent when background export ready
- [ ] Download link valid and working
- [ ] Filenames follow naming convention
- [ ] Success message displayed
- [ ] Audit trail records export operation
- [ ] All formats meet performance requirements
