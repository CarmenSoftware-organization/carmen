### 1.2 Scope
This document defines business requirements for:
- Recipe creation and lifecycle management
- Ingredient management with wastage tracking
- Preparation step documentation with media support
- Multi-level cost calculation (ingredient, labor, overhead)
- Yield variant management for fractional sales
- Pricing strategy analysis and recommendations
- Carbon footprint tracking
- Recipe publishing and version control

### 1.3 Key Business Objectives
- **Standardization**: Maintain consistent recipe execution across locations
- **Cost Control**: Accurate food cost calculation and margin analysis
- **Pricing Optimization**: Data-driven pricing recommendations based on target margins
- **Flexibility**: Support various sales units (whole, half, slice, portion)
- **Sustainability**: Track and report environmental impact
- **Efficiency**: Streamline recipe documentation and updates
- **Compliance**: Track allergens and dietary information

## 3. Business Rules

### BR-REC-001: Recipe Name Uniqueness
**Rule**: Recipe names must be unique across the entire system.

**Rationale**: Prevents confusion in recipe selection and reporting.

**Validation**:
- Check uniqueness on create
- Check uniqueness on update (exclude current record)
- Case-insensitive comparison

**Error Message**: "A recipe with this name already exists. Please choose a unique name."

### BR-REC-002: Required Fields for Publishing
**Rule**: Recipes must have all required fields completed before publishing.

**Required Fields**:
- Recipe name
- Description (minimum 10 characters)
- Category
- Cuisine type
- At least one yield variant
- At least one ingredient
- At least one preparation step
- Recipe image
- Cost per portion calculated
- Selling price defined

**Validation**: Run pre-publish checklist and block if any required field missing.

**Error Message**: "Cannot publish recipe. Please complete: [list of missing fields]."

### BR-REC-003: Cost Calculation Integrity
**Rule**: All cost calculations must be mathematically accurate and consistent.

**Formulas**:
```
Ingredient Total Cost = Quantity × Cost per Unit × (1 + Wastage% / 100)
Total Ingredient Cost = Sum of all ingredient total costs
Labor Cost = Total Ingredient Cost × (Labor% / 100)
Overhead Cost = Total Ingredient Cost × (Overhead% / 100)
Total Recipe Cost = Total Ingredient Cost + Labor Cost + Overhead Cost
Cost per Portion = Total Recipe Cost / Yield Quantity
Actual Food Cost % = (Cost per Portion / Selling Price) × 100
Gross Profit = Selling Price - Cost per Portion
Gross Margin % = (Gross Profit / Selling Price) × 100
```

**Validation**: Recalculate on any ingredient or cost parameter change.

### BR-REC-004: Yield Variant Consistency
**Rule**: Yield variant conversion rates must sum logically for fractional sales.

**Requirements**:
- Conversion rate range: 0.01 to 1.0
- Conversion rate represents portion of base recipe
- All variants must reference same base yield
- Prices should scale proportionally (with markup adjustments)

**Example Validation**:
- Pizza (8 slices): Slice = 1/8 (0.125), Half = 1/2 (0.5), Whole = 1.0
- Verify: Slice price × 8 ≤ Whole price (allows bulk discount)

### BR-REC-005: Ingredient Type Constraints
**Rule**: Ingredients must reference valid, active records in the system.

**Constraints**:
- Product ingredients: Must exist in inventory system with active status
- Recipe ingredients: Must reference published recipes (no draft recipes)
- Circular references not allowed (Recipe A → Recipe B → Recipe A)
- Maximum recipe nesting depth: 3 levels

**Validation**:
- Check ingredient existence on add
- Verify active status
- Detect circular dependencies
- Alert if ingredient unavailable

### BR-REC-006: Preparation Step Ordering
**Rule**: Preparation steps must be sequentially numbered without gaps.

**Requirements**:
- Steps numbered 1, 2, 3, ... N
- No duplicate step numbers
- No gaps in sequence
- Auto-renumber on step deletion
- Auto-renumber on step reordering

**Behavior**: When step deleted, all subsequent steps renumbered automatically.

### BR-REC-007: Target Cost Percentage Limits
**Rule**: Target food cost percentage must fall within acceptable range.

**Range**: 15% - 50%
**Industry Standard**: 25% - 35%
**Warning Threshold**: < 20% or > 40%

**Validation**:
- Alert if target set below 15% (unrealistic margin)
- Alert if target set above 50% (poor profitability)
- Provide industry benchmark guidance

### BR-REC-008: Wastage Percentage Constraints
**Rule**: Wastage percentage must be realistic and justified.

**Range**: 0% - 50%
**Typical Values**:
- Dry goods: 0-2%
- Fresh produce: 5-15%
- Proteins: 5-20%
- Specialty items: 10-30%

**Validation**:
- Alert if wastage > 50% (requires justification)
- Alert if wastage changes significantly from historical average
- Track wastage trends for cost control

### BR-REC-009: Recipe Status Workflow
**Rule**: Recipe status follows controlled workflow.

**Workflow**:
1. **Draft**: Initial creation, editing allowed
2. **Published**: Active for production use, version control on changes

**State Transitions**:
- Draft → Published: Requires validation and approval
- Published → Draft: Reverts to editable state (creates new version)
- No deletion of published recipes (archive only)

**Business Logic**:
- Draft recipes not visible to kitchen staff
- Published recipes available in POS and production
- Changing published recipe creates new version automatically

### BR-REC-010: Pricing Alert Thresholds
**Rule**: System generates alerts when pricing metrics fall outside acceptable ranges.

**Alert Conditions**:
- **Critical**: Actual Food Cost % > Target + 10%
- **Warning**: Actual Food Cost % > Target + 5%
- **Info**: Gross Margin < 60%
- **Critical**: Selling price < Cost per portion (negative margin)

**Alert Actions**:
- Display visual indicator (color coding)
- Generate pricing report
- Notify management
- Suggest corrective actions

### BR-REC-011: Sub-Recipe Dependency Management
**Rule**: Sub-recipes (recipe ingredients) must be properly managed.

**Requirements**:
- Sub-recipe must be published before use
- Cost of sub-recipe included in parent recipe cost
- Changes to sub-recipe trigger parent recipe cost updates
- Circular dependencies prevented (Recipe A cannot use Recipe B if Recipe B uses Recipe A)
- Maximum nesting depth: 3 levels (Recipe → Sub-Recipe → Sub-Sub-Recipe)

**Validation**:
- Check sub-recipe status on parent recipe publish
- Detect circular references
- Alert parent recipes when sub-recipe changes
- Recalculate parent costs when sub-recipe costs update

### BR-REC-012: Allergen Disclosure Requirements
**Rule**: All allergens must be properly declared for compliance.

**Common Allergens** (FDA Major Allergens):
- Milk (Dairy)
- Eggs
- Fish
- Shellfish
- Tree Nuts
- Peanuts
- Wheat (Gluten)
- Soybeans

**Requirements**:
- Allergen selection from standardized list
- Inherit allergens from ingredients automatically
- Display allergen warnings prominently
- Include in printed recipe cards
- Searchable/filterable by allergen

**Validation**:
- Alert if allergen not declared but present in ingredients
- Require confirmation before removing allergen declaration

### BR-REC-013: Media Asset Requirements
**Rule**: Recipe images must meet quality and technical standards.

**Requirements**:
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: Maximum 10MB per image
- **Resolution**: Minimum 800×600px, Recommended 1200×800px
- **Aspect Ratio**: 3:2 or 4:3 preferred
- **Alt Text**: Required for accessibility
- **Copyright**: User confirms rights to upload

**Validation**:
- Check file format and size on upload
- Validate image dimensions
- Scan for inappropriate content (optional)
- Compress and optimize for web delivery
