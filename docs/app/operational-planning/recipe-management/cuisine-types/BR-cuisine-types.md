- **Operational Efficiency**: Grouping recipes with similar ingredients and techniques

### 1.3 Scope
**In Scope**:
- Cuisine type creation, modification, and deletion
- Region-based categorization
- Popular dishes and key ingredients tracking
- Recipe count metrics and analytics
- Status management (active/inactive)
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Bulk operations
- Import/export functionality

**Out of Scope**:
- Recipe creation and management (separate submodule)
- Menu engineering and pricing (separate submodule)

## 3. Business Rules

### BR-CUI-001: Cuisine Code Uniqueness
**Rule**: Each cuisine type must have a unique code across the entire system.

**Rationale**: Codes are used as identifiers in integrations and references.

**Enforcement**:
- Client: Real-time validation during entry
- Server: Unique constraint validation
- Database: UNIQUE constraint on code column

**Error Message**: "Cuisine code '{code}' is already in use by '{name}'"

### BR-CUI-002: Cuisine Name Uniqueness
**Rule**: Each cuisine type must have a unique name (case-insensitive) across the entire system.

**Rationale**: Prevents confusion and ensures clear identification of cuisines.

**Enforcement**:
- Client: Real-time validation during entry
- Server: Case-insensitive uniqueness check
- Database: UNIQUE constraint with case-insensitive index

**Error Message**: "Cuisine name '{name}' is already in use"

### BR-CUI-003: Region Validation
**Rule**: Region must be one of the predefined valid regions.

**Valid Regions**:
- Asia
- Europe
- Americas
- Africa
- Middle East
- Oceania

**Rationale**: Standardized regions enable consistent reporting and analysis.

**Enforcement**:
- Client: Dropdown selection only
- Server: Enum validation
- Database: CHECK constraint

**Error Message**: "Invalid region. Must be one of: {valid regions}"

### BR-CUI-004: Code Format Validation
**Rule**: Cuisine code must contain only uppercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.

**Format Pattern**: `^[A-Z0-9\-_]+$`

**Examples**:
- Valid: "ITA", "CHN", "MEX-TRADITIONAL", "IND_NORTH"
- Invalid: "ita", "Italian", "MEX@", "中文"

**Rationale**: Ensures codes are suitable for URLs, file names, and system integrations.

**Enforcement**:
- Client: Pattern validation and auto-uppercase
- Server: Regex validation
- Database: CHECK constraint with regex

**Error Message**: "Code must contain only uppercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores"

### BR-CUI-005: Deletion with Active Recipes (BLOCKING)
**Rule**: Cannot delete a cuisine type that has active recipes assigned to it.

**Rationale**: Prevents data integrity issues and broken recipe references.

**Required Action**: User must first reassign or deactivate all recipes

**Enforcement**:
- Client: Show error and block delete button
- Server: Count validation before deletion
- Database: RESTRICT foreign key constraint

**Error Message**: "Cannot delete cuisine type with {count} active recipe(s). Please reassign or deactivate recipes first."

### BR-CUI-006: Deletion with Inactive Recipes (WARNING)
**Rule**: Warn user when deleting a cuisine type that has inactive recipes.

**Rationale**: User should be aware of historical data impact.

**User Options**:
- Cancel deletion
- Proceed with deletion (inactive recipes reassigned to "Uncategorized")

**Enforcement**:
- Client: Show warning dialog with recipe count
- Server: Validation check with warning flag

**Warning Message**: "This cuisine has {count} inactive recipe(s) that will be reassigned to 'Uncategorized'. Continue?"

### BR-CUI-007: Status Change with Active Recipes
**Rule**: Can deactivate cuisine even with active recipes, but show warning.

**Rationale**: Allows operational flexibility while maintaining awareness.

**Impact**: Recipes remain active but cuisine marked inactive for new assignments.

**Enforcement**:
- Client: Show warning dialog with recipe count
- Server: Allow status change with logging

**Warning Message**: "This cuisine has {count} active recipe(s). Deactivating will prevent new recipes from using this cuisine."

### BR-CUI-008: Popular Dishes Format
**Rule**: Popular dishes must be stored as array of strings.

**Format**: Comma-separated values in UI, JSON array in database

**Validation**:
- Each dish name: 2-50 characters
- Maximum 20 dishes per cuisine
- Duplicate dish names removed automatically

**Enforcement**:
- Client: Parse comma-separated input
- Server: Validate array format and content
- Database: Store as JSON array

**Error Message**: "Each popular dish must be 2-50 characters. Maximum 20 dishes allowed."

### BR-CUI-009: Key Ingredients Format
**Rule**: Key ingredients must be stored as array of strings.

**Format**: Comma-separated values in UI, JSON array in database

**Validation**:
- Each ingredient: 2-50 characters
- Maximum 30 ingredients per cuisine
- Duplicate ingredients removed automatically

**Enforcement**:
- Client: Parse comma-separated input
- Server: Validate array format and content
- Database: Store as JSON array

**Error Message**: "Each key ingredient must be 2-50 characters. Maximum 30 ingredients allowed."

### BR-CUI-010: Name Format Validation
**Rule**: Cuisine name must contain only letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, ampersands, apostrophes, and parentheses.

**Format Pattern**: `^[a-zA-Z0-9\s\-&'()]+$`

**Examples**:
- Valid: "Italian", "Chinese (Cantonese)", "Mexican - Traditional", "Chef's Special"
- Invalid: "Italian@", "Chinese#Cuisine", "Mexican|Style"

**Rationale**: Ensures names are suitable for display and reporting.

**Enforcement**:
- Client: Pattern validation with helpful message
- Server: Regex validation
- Database: No special constraint (text field)

**Error Message**: "Name can only contain letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, ampersands, apostrophes, and parentheses"

### BR-CUI-011: Description Minimum Length
**Rule**: Description must be at least 10 characters to ensure meaningful content.

**Rationale**: Prevents low-quality or placeholder descriptions.

**Enforcement**:
- Client: Character count validation
- Server: Length validation
- Database: CHECK constraint

**Error Message**: "Description must be at least 10 characters"

### BR-CUI-012: Sort Order Uniqueness (RECOMMENDED)
**Rule**: Sort order values should be unique to ensure predictable ordering.

**Rationale**: Duplicate sort orders create ambiguous display sequence.

**Enforcement**:
- Client: Warning if duplicate sort order detected
- Server: No blocking validation (business rule)
- Database: No constraint (allows duplicates)

**Warning Message**: "Sort order {value} is already used. Consider using a unique value for predictable ordering."

### BR-CUI-013: Recipe Count Calculation
**Rule**: Recipe counts (total and active) must be automatically calculated from Recipe table.

**Calculation Logic**:
- `recipeCount`: COUNT of all recipes with this cuisine ID
- `activeRecipeCount`: COUNT of recipes with this cuisine ID AND status = 'active'

**Update Triggers**:
- When recipe is created
- When recipe cuisine is changed
- When recipe status is changed
- When recipe is deleted

**Enforcement**:
- Server: Calculated fields, not user-editable
- Database: Triggers update counts on recipe changes

**Validation**: Active count cannot exceed total count
