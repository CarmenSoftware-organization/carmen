## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
The Recipe Categories submodule provides hierarchical categorization of recipes to support kitchen workflow organization, menu structuring, cost control, and operational planning. It enables Head Chefs, Sous Chefs, and Kitchen Managers to organize recipes into logical groups with default cost settings and margin targets.

### 1.2 Business Context
In hospitality operations, recipe categorization is critical for:
- **Kitchen Workflow**: Organizing recipes by preparation station (appetizers, mains, desserts)
- **Menu Organization**: Structuring menu sections and pricing strategies
- **Cost Control**: Setting category-specific cost and margin targets
- **Operational Planning**: Planning production schedules and resource allocation
- **Performance Analysis**: Tracking profitability by category

### 1.3 Scope
This document covers:
- Hierarchical category management (parent-child relationships)
- Category creation, editing, viewing, and deletion
- Default cost settings and margin targets per category
- Category status and display order management
- Search, filtering, and bulk operations
- Category performance metrics and analytics

## 3. Business Rules

### BR-CAT-001: Category Code Uniqueness
**Rule**: Each category must have a unique category code across all categories.
**Validation**: System prevents saving categories with duplicate codes.
**Error**: "Category code '[CODE]' is already in use. Please choose a unique code."

### BR-CAT-002: Category Name Uniqueness
**Rule**: Each category must have a unique name across all categories.
**Validation**: System prevents saving categories with duplicate names.
**Error**: "Category name '[NAME]' already exists. Please choose a different name."

### BR-CAT-003: Hierarchy Depth Limit
**Rule**: Categories can only have 2 levels of hierarchy (parent and child).
**Validation**: System prevents creating subcategories under level 2 categories.
**Error**: "Cannot create subcategory. Maximum hierarchy depth (2 levels) reached."

### BR-CAT-004: Parent Category Consistency
**Rule**: Cannot set a category as its own parent or create circular references.
**Validation**: System validates parent selection prevents circular relationships.
**Error**: "Invalid parent selection. Cannot create circular category relationships."

### BR-CAT-005: Deletion with Active Recipes
**Rule**: Cannot delete categories that have active recipes.
**Validation**: System prevents deletion if active recipes exist in category.
**Error**: "Cannot delete category '[NAME]'. It contains [N] active recipe(s). Deactivate or move recipes first."

### BR-CAT-006: Deletion with Subcategories
**Rule**: Cannot delete categories that have subcategories.
**Validation**: System prevents deletion if subcategories exist.
**Error**: "Cannot delete category '[NAME]'. It has [N] subcategory(ies). Delete or move subcategories first."

### BR-CAT-007: Cost Percentage Validation
**Rule**: Labor, overhead, and food cost percentages must be between 0-100%.
**Validation**: System validates each percentage is within valid range.
**Error**: "[Field] must be between 0 and 100%."

### BR-CAT-008: Total Cost Percentage Warning
**Rule**: Sum of labor%, overhead%, and food cost% should not exceed 100%.
**Validation**: System shows warning but allows saving (not enforced).
**Warning**: "Total cost percentage ([X]%) exceeds 100%. This may result in unachievable margins."

### BR-CAT-009: Margin Relationship Validation
**Rule**: Target margin percentage must be greater than or equal to minimum margin percentage.
**Validation**: System enforces target >= minimum.
**Error**: "Target margin ([X]%) must be greater than or equal to minimum margin ([Y]%)."

### BR-CAT-010: Achievable Margin Validation
**Rule**: If total costs >= 100%, margins are mathematically unachievable.
**Validation**: System calculates and warns if margins unachievable.
**Warning**: "With current cost settings ([X]%), the target margin ([Y]%) is mathematically unachievable."

### BR-CAT-011: Status Change Impact
**Rule**: Deactivating a category does not affect existing recipes.
**Behavior**: Recipes remain active but cannot be assigned to inactive categories.
**Note**: Inactive categories hidden from selection dropdowns but visible in list with filter.

### BR-CAT-012: Default Settings Inheritance
**Rule**: New recipes created in a category inherit that category's default settings.
**Behavior**: Cost settings and margin targets copied to new recipe on creation.
**Note**: Changes to category defaults do not retroactively update existing recipes.

### BR-CAT-013: Parent Category Modification with Recipes
**Rule**: Cannot change parent category if category has recipes assigned.
**Validation**: System prevents parent change when recipes exist.
**Error**: "Cannot change parent category. This category has [N] recipe(s) assigned. Category structure locked."

### BR-CAT-014: Sort Order Validation
**Rule**: Sort order must be a positive integer.
**Validation**: System validates sort order is numeric and > 0.
**Error**: "Sort order must be a positive number."

### BR-CAT-015: Required Field Validation
**Rule**: Name, code, and description are required fields.
**Validation**: System prevents saving without required fields.
**Error**: "[Field name] is required."

### BR-CAT-016: Subcategory Settings Independence
**Rule**: Subcategories can override parent default settings.
**Behavior**: Subcategory settings take precedence over parent for recipes in that subcategory.
**Note**: Comparison tooltip shows parent vs child settings for transparency.

### BR-CAT-017: Performance Metric Calculation
**Rule**: Metrics calculate from active recipes only.
**Calculation**:
- Average Cost = SUM(recipe costs) / COUNT(active recipes)
- Average Margin = SUM(recipe margins) / COUNT(active recipes)
**Update Frequency**: Metrics recalculate on recipe changes (max 1 minute delay).

### BR-CAT-018: Category Code Format
**Rule**: Category codes should follow naming convention (uppercase letters, hyphens allowed).
**Validation**: System suggests code if not provided (auto-generated from name).
**Format**: Example: "APP", "MAIN-MEAT", "DES"
