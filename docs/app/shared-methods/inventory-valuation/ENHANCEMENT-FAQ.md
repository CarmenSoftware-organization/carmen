## General Questions

### Q1: What is the inventory valuation enhancement program?

**A**: The enhancement program is a systematic upgrade of the Carmen ERP inventory valuation system from its current solid foundation (v1.0) to a fully-featured enterprise-grade lot-based costing platform (v2.0). The program consists of 5 phases over 8-11 weeks, adding capabilities while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing functionality.

**Timeline**: 8-11 weeks total
**Current Phase**: Phase 0 - Documentation & Planning
**Investment**: Development time only (no licensing costs)
**Backward Compatibility**: 100% - all existing features continue to work

---

### Q2: Why are we doing this enhancement program?

**A**: The current system (v1.0) works well for basic lot-based inventory costing, but lacks advanced features needed for:

**Operational Efficiency**:
- Automatic lot number generation (eliminating manual entry errors)
- Complete lot traceability (quality recalls, supplier issues)
- Automated period close (reducing 4-hour manual process to <5 minutes)

**Financial Control**:
- Period locking (preventing backdated changes)
- Historical data preservation (accurate period-to-period comparisons)
- Audit-ready compliance (complete transaction audit trail)

**Performance**:
- 75-90% faster queries
- Instant historical reports (<1 second vs 5+ seconds)
- Optimized FIFO algorithms

**Business Value**: Estimated 3-4 month payback period through time savings and error reduction

---

### Q3: Will my data be affected during the upgrade?

**A**: **No, your data is completely safe**:

✅ **Data Preservation**:
- No data deletion
- No format changes to existing lots
- Complete audit trail preserved
- Historical calculations remain accurate

✅ **Backward Compatibility**:
- Existing lot numbers remain valid
- Current reports continue to work
- Existing workflows supported
- No data migration required

⚠️ **Enhancement Approach**:
- New features are **additions**, not replacements
- Old and new features work side-by-side during transition
- You choose when to adopt new features (except Phase 4 period management)

---

### Q4: Do I need to do anything during the upgrade?

**A**: Minimal action required, varies by phase:

**Phase 1-3** (Schema, Lot, FIFO):
- **Downtime**: 2-4 hours for Phase 1, <30 minutes for Phase 2-3
- **Action Needed**: None - enhancements are automatic
- **Training**: Optional familiarization with new features
- **Impact**: Low - system updates happen behind the scenes

**Phase 4** (Period Management):
- **Downtime**: None (new features added without interruption)
- **Action Needed**: **Training required** on new period close procedures
- **Training Duration**: 2-hour session + practice
- **Impact**: Medium - new month-end close workflow

**Phase 5** (Reporting & Polish):
- **Downtime**: None
- **Action Needed**: None - enhanced reports available immediately
- **Training**: Optional familiarization with new reports
- **Impact**: Low - performance improvements automatic

---

### Q5: What if something goes wrong during the upgrade?

**A**: Comprehensive safety measures are in place:

**Before Each Phase**:
- ✅ Complete database backup
- ✅ Staging environment testing
- ✅ User acceptance testing
- ✅ Rollback plan prepared

**During Deployment**:
- ✅ Downtime windows announced 1 week in advance
- ✅ Real-time monitoring
- ✅ IT support on standby
- ✅ Rollback capability within 30 minutes

**After Deployment**:
- ✅ Validation checks run automatically
- ✅ 24-hour monitoring period
- ✅ Support hotline available
- ✅ Issue reporting system active

**Rollback Policy**: If critical issues arise in first 24 hours, we can roll back to previous version within 30 minutes with zero data loss.

---

## Current System Questions

### Q6: What works well in the current system that we should keep using?

**A**: The current system (v1.0) has several strengths that will continue to work perfectly:

✅ **Lot-Based Tracking**:
- Lot number format: `{LOCATION}-{YYMMDD}-{SEQ}` works great
- Natural FIFO sorting via embedded dates
- Complete transaction history preservation

✅ **Dual Costing Methods**:
- FIFO and Periodic Average both work correctly
- Company-wide method selection
- Consistent financial reporting

✅ **Real-Time Calculations**:
- `SUM(in_qty) - SUM(out_qty)` is the RIGHT approach
- No stored balances to get out of sync
- Transaction history as single source of truth

**Recommendation**: Continue using these features exactly as you do today. Enhancements build on this solid foundation.

---

### Q7: What are the current system's limitations that will be fixed?

**A**: Five main limitations will be addressed:

**Limitation 1: Manual Lot Number Entry** (Fixed in Phase 2)
- **Current**: Manual typing with risk of errors
- **Future**: Automatic generation with zero errors

**Limitation 2: Limited Transaction Categorization** (Fixed in Phase 1)
- **Current**: Must infer type from `in_qty`/`out_qty` patterns
- **Future**: Explicit `transaction_type` field (LOT, ADJUSTMENT, TRANSFER)

**Limitation 3: Incomplete Traceability** (Fixed in Phase 3)
- **Current**: Cannot directly trace consumption back to source lot
- **Future**: Automatic `parent_lot_no` linkage for one-click traceability

**Limitation 4: No Period Locking** (Fixed in Phase 4)
- **Current**: Cannot prevent backdated changes
- **Future**: OPEN → CLOSED → LOCKED lifecycle with enforcement

**Limitation 5: No Automated Snapshots** (Fixed in Phase 4)
- **Current**: Historical reports recalculated each time
- **Future**: Period-end snapshots preserve historical data permanently

---

### Q8: Can I continue using the system during the enhancement program?

**A**: **Yes, with minimal interruption**:

**Normal Operations** (99% of the time):
- ✅ Full system availability
- ✅ All features working normally
- ✅ No performance degradation
- ✅ Normal business operations

**Planned Downtime** (1% of the time):
- ⏳ Phase 1: 2-4 hours (one-time, scheduled)
- ⏳ Phase 2: <30 minutes (scheduled)
- ⏳ Phase 3: No downtime (background deployment)
- ⏳ Phase 4: No downtime (new features added)
- ⏳ Phase 5: No downtime (performance optimization)

**Total Downtime**: Maximum 4.5 hours over 11 weeks (99.97% uptime)

**Scheduling**: All downtime windows will be scheduled during lowest-usage periods (typically early Sunday morning) and announced 1 week in advance.

---

## Enhancement Timeline Questions

### Q9: What is the overall timeline for all enhancements?

**A**: 8-11 weeks total, broken into 5 phases:

```
Phase 0: Documentation & Planning    (Current)
Phase 1: Schema Enhancement          (Week 1-2)    1-2 weeks
Phase 2: Lot Standardization         (Week 3)      1 week
Phase 3: FIFO Algorithm Enhancement  (Week 4-6)    2-3 weeks
Phase 4: Period Management           (Week 7-9)    2-3 weeks
Phase 5: Reporting & Polish          (Week 10-11)  2 weeks
```

**Start Date**: TBD (after stakeholder approval)
**Completion**: 8-11 weeks after start
**Progress Updates**: Weekly email with current status and next steps

---

### Q10: Can we skip phases or do them out of order?

**A**: **No, phases must be completed sequentially** due to dependencies:

**Why Sequential?**:
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 schema changes
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 1 parent lot field
- Phase 4 depends on Phase 3 FIFO enhancements
- Phase 5 depends on Phase 4 snapshots

**Example Dependency**:
```
Phase 1: Adds parent_lot_no field (required)
Phase 3: Uses parent_lot_no for traceability (depends on Phase 1)
```

**Can We Accelerate?**:
- ✅ Yes - with additional resources, some phases can overlap partially
- ✅ Minimum timeline: ~8 weeks (with parallel work where possible)
- ❌ Cannot skip phases entirely - each builds on previous

---

### Q11: What happens if we need to pause the enhancement program?

**A**: Enhancement program can be paused safely at phase boundaries:

**Safe Pause Points**:
- ✅ After Phase 1 completes (schema enhanced, backward compatible)
- ✅ After Phase 2 completes (lot generation added, optional to use)
- ✅ After Phase 3 completes (traceability enhanced, backward compatible)
- ⚠️ After Phase 4 completes (period management requires ongoing use)

**Resuming Later**:
- ✅ Can resume from any pause point
- ✅ No data loss during pause
- ✅ No regression of completed phases
- ⚠️ May need brief refresher training

**Recommendation**: If possible, complete through Phase 3, then pause if needed. Phase 4 is a good stopping point if you need to delay Phase 5.

---

### Q12: When will each phase be deployed?

**A**: Deployment schedule (tentative, pending approval):

**Phase 1** - Week 1-2:
- Development: 1-2 weeks
- Testing: 3-5 days
- Deployment: Sunday early morning (2-4 hour downtime)
- Validation: 24-48 hours

**Phase 2** - Week 3:
- Development: 1 week
- Testing: 2-3 days
- Deployment: Sunday early morning (<30 min downtime)
- Validation: 24 hours

**Phase 3** - Week 4-6:
- Development: 2-3 weeks
- Testing: 3-5 days
- Deployment: Gradual rollout (no downtime)
- Validation: 48 hours

**Phase 4** - Week 7-9:
- Development: 2-3 weeks
- Testing: 5-7 days
- Training: 1 week before deployment
- Deployment: Gradual rollout (no downtime)
- Validation: 1 week (first period close)

**Phase 5** - Week 10-11:
- Development: 2 weeks
- Testing: 3-5 days
- Deployment: Gradual rollout (no downtime)
- Validation: Performance monitoring (ongoing)

---

## Technical Questions

### Q13: Will the lot number format change?

**A**: **No, the format remains exactly the same**:

**Current Format** (v1.0): `{LOCATION}-{YYMMDD}-{SEQ}`
**Future Format** (v2.0): `{LOCATION}-{YYMMDD}-{SEQ}` (unchanged)

**Examples**:
- `MK-250115-0001` (Main Kitchen, January 15, 2025, sequence 01)
- `BAR-250116-0002` (Bar, January 16, 2025, sequence 02)
- `KC-251105-0001` (Kakadiya Kitchen, November 5, 2025, sequence 01)

**What Changes**:
- ✅ Phase 2 adds **automatic generation** (optional to use)
- ✅ Phase 2 adds **format validation** (ensures consistency)
- ✅ Existing manual lot numbers remain valid forever

**Migration**: No lot number migration needed. All existing lots continue to work.

---

### Q14: How does FIFO ordering work with the date embedded in lot numbers?

**A**: Natural chronological sorting without separate date fields:

**How It Works**:
```sql
ORDER BY lot_no ASC   -- Natural FIFO sort

Example Sort Order:
MK-250110-0001  (January 10, 2025) ← Oldest, consumed first
MK-250110-0002  (January 10, 2025) ← Same day, sequence 02
MK-250115-0001  (January 15, 2025)
MK-250120-0001  (January 20, 2025) ← Newest, consumed last
```

**Why This Design?**:
- ✅ Simpler database schema (no separate date field)
- ✅ Faster queries (no date parsing needed)
- ✅ Natural sort order (alphabetic = chronologic)
- ✅ Human-readable lot numbers

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- ✅ Same-day lots: Sequence number controls order
- ✅ Partial lot consumption: Balances calculated correctly
- ✅ Zero balance lots: Marked as EXHAUSTED but preserved for history

---

### Q15: What is the difference between LOT and ADJUSTMENT transaction types?

**A**: Clear distinction added in Phase 1:

**LOT Transaction** (Receipt):
```json
{
  "lot_no": "MK-250115-001",
  "transaction_type": "LOT",      // ⭐ Receipt creating new lot
  "parent_lot_no": null,          // No parent (this IS the source)
  "in_qty": 100.00000,
  "out_qty": 0.00000,
  "cost_per_unit": 12.50000
}
```

**ADJUSTMENT Transaction** (Consumption):
```json
{
  "lot_no": "MK-250115-001",
  "transaction_type": "ADJUSTMENT",  // ⭐ Consumption reducing lot
  "parent_lot_no": "MK-250110-001",   // ⭐ Source lot consumed from
  "in_qty": 0.00000,
  "out_qty": 25.00000,
  "cost_per_unit": 12.50000
}
```

**Why This Matters**:
- ✅ Clear distinction: Receipt vs Consumption
- ✅ Simplified queries: `WHERE transaction_type = 'LOT'`
- ✅ Better analytics: Group by transaction type
- ✅ Accurate audit trail: Explicit categorization

**Other Types**:
- `TRANSFER`: Movement between locations
- `PHYSICAL_COUNT`: Inventory count adjustment
- `WASTAGE`: Spoilage or loss
- `PRODUCTION`: Manufacturing consumption

---

### Q16: How is balance calculated without a stored balance field?

**A**: Real-time calculation from transaction history (CORRECT design):

**Current Calculation**:
```sql
SELECT
  lot_no,
  SUM(in_qty) - SUM(out_qty) as current_balance
FROM tb_inventory_transaction_closing_balance
WHERE lot_no = 'MK-250115-001'
GROUP BY lot_no
```

**Why No Stored Balance?**:
- ✅ **Single Source of Truth**: Transaction history never lies
- ✅ **No Sync Issues**: Balances always accurate
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Every change preserved forever
- ✅ **Point-in-Time Queries**: Can calculate balance at any historical date

**Performance**:
- Current: ~200ms for single lot (acceptable)
- Phase 5: <50ms with optimization (target 75% improvement)

**Snapshots** (Phase 4):
- Period-end snapshots **cache** calculated balances
- Historical reports use snapshots (instant retrieval)
- Real-time queries still calculate from transactions

---

### Q17: What are the 8 transaction types and why are they important?

**A**: The system uses 8 explicit transaction types to clearly categorize inventory movements:

**LOT Layer** (parent_lot_no IS NULL - creates new lots):
1. **RECEIVE**: Initial receipt from supplier (GRN) - creates new inventory lot
2. **TRANSFER_IN**: Receipt from another location - creates new lot at destination
3. **OPEN**: Opening balance for new period - standardized to period average
4. **CLOSE**: Closing balance revaluation - standardized to period average

**ADJUSTMENT Layer** (parent_lot_no IS NOT NULL - modifies existing lots):
5. **ISSUE**: Consumption to production/sales - reduces parent lot balance
6. **ADJ_IN**: Inventory increase adjustment - cannot exceed parent lot's original receipt
7. **ADJ_OUT**: Inventory decrease (write-off, return, spoilage) - reduces parent lot
8. **TRANSFER_OUT**: Transfer to another location - reduces source lot balance

**Why Important**:
- ✅ **Crystal Clear Intent**: No more inferring transaction type from qty fields
- ✅ **Accurate Reporting**: Type-based filtering and categorization
- ✅ **Layer Logic**: Automatic LOT vs ADJUSTMENT layer identification
- ✅ **Traceability**: Parent-child relationships clearly defined
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete transparency in transaction categorization

**Example**:
```
RECEIVE (LOT layer):
- lot_no: MK-250115-0001
- parent_lot_no: NULL
- transaction_type: RECEIVE
- in_qty: 100, out_qty: 0

ISSUE (ADJUSTMENT layer):
- lot_no: MK-250120-ADJ-001
- parent_lot_no: MK-250115-0001  (references source lot)
- transaction_type: ISSUE
- in_qty: 0, out_qty: 25
```

---

### Q18: How does the layer logic work with parent_lot_no?

**A**: Layer type is automatically determined by parent_lot_no presence:

**LOT Layer** (parent_lot_no IS NULL):
- Creates **independent** new lot with its own balance
- Used for: RECEIVE, TRANSFER_IN, OPEN, CLOSE
- Balance tracked separately from other lots
- Can be consumed by ADJUSTMENT layer transactions

**ADJUSTMENT Layer** (parent_lot_no IS NOT NULL):
- **References** and **reduces** parent lot balance
- Used for: ISSUE, ADJ_IN, ADJ_OUT, TRANSFER_OUT
- Cannot exist without parent lot
- Consumption follows FIFO from oldest parent lots first

**Key Rules**:
- ✅ RECEIVE creates LOT layer (no parent) at actual cost
- ✅ ISSUE creates ADJUSTMENT layer (has parent) consuming from LOT
- ✅ TRANSFER_OUT creates ADJUSTMENT at source (has parent)
- ✅ TRANSFER_IN creates LOT at destination (no parent, new lot)
- ✅ CLOSE/OPEN create LOT layers (no parent) for revaluation
- ✅ ADJ_IN cannot exceed parent lot's original receipt quantity

**Example Transaction Flow**:
```
1. RECEIVE: MK-250115-0001 (100 kg @ $10.00) - LOT layer, parent_lot_no = NULL
2. ISSUE: ADJ-001 consumes 25 kg - ADJUSTMENT layer, parent_lot_no = MK-250115-0001
3. ISSUE: ADJ-002 consumes 50 kg - ADJUSTMENT layer, parent_lot_no = MK-250115-0001
4. Remaining: MK-250115-0001 balance = 25 kg (100 - 25 - 50)
```

---

### Q19: What is ADJ_IN and why can't it exceed the parent lot?

**A**: ADJ_IN is an upward inventory adjustment with business rule constraints:

**Purpose**: Correct inventory shortages discovered after physical count or receiving errors

**Constraint**: Cannot increase quantity beyond parent lot's **original receipt**

**Why This Constraint**:
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: Prevents creating inventory from nothing
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Ensures adjustments reference actual receipts
- ✅ **Quality Control**: Adjustments must be corrections, not new inventory
- ✅ **Compliance**: Maintains clear source-to-adjustment linkage

**Example Scenarios**:

**Valid ADJ_IN**:
```
1. Original RECEIVE: MK-250115-0001 (100 kg @ $10.00)
2. ISSUE consumption: 30 kg (balance: 70 kg)
3. Physical count finds: 75 kg (5 kg shortage was incorrect)
4. ADJ_IN: +5 kg (valid, does not exceed 100 kg original)
   Result: Balance = 75 kg (within original 100 kg receipt)
```

**Invalid ADJ_IN** (would be rejected):
```
1. Original RECEIVE: MK-250115-0001 (100 kg @ $10.00)
2. ISSUE consumption: 30 kg (balance: 70 kg)
3. Attempt ADJ_IN: +50 kg
   ERROR: Would make balance 120 kg, exceeding original 100 kg receipt
   Must create new RECEIVE transaction instead
```

**When to Use RECEIVE Instead of ADJ_IN**:
- New deliveries from supplier → RECEIVE
- Additional quantity beyond original receipt → RECEIVE
- Discovered inventory from unknown source → Investigate, then RECEIVE with explanation

## Operations Impact Questions

### Q17: Will I need to change how I enter GRN transactions?

**A**: Mostly the same, with optional improvements:

**Phase 1-2** (Week 1-3):
- **Current Process**: Enter lot number manually
- **New Option** (Phase 2): Click "Generate Lot Number" button
- **Recommendation**: Start using auto-generation to eliminate errors

**Phase 3-5** (Week 4-11):
- **No Changes**: GRN entry process remains the same
- **Enhancement**: System auto-links consumption to source lots (behind the scenes)

**Example Process Evolution**:
```
v1.0 (Current):
1. Receive goods
2. Type lot number: MK-250115-0001 (manual, error-prone)
3. Enter quantity and cost
4. Save GRN

v1.2 (Phase 2):
1. Receive goods
2. Click "Generate Lot Number" → MK-250115-0001 (automatic)
3. Enter quantity and cost
4. Save GRN
```

**Training**: 10-minute walkthrough of lot generation button (Phase 2)

---

### Q18: How will period close procedures change?

**A**: Dramatically simplified automation (Phase 4):

**Current Process** (v1.0):
```
Manual Period Close (4 hours):
1. Export all month-end reports → 30 min
2. Manually reconcile balances → 2 hours
3. Archive reports to shared drive → 15 min
4. Email reports to finance team → 15 min
5. Update period tracking spreadsheet → 30 min
```

**Future Process** (v2.0):
```
Automated Period Close (<5 minutes):
1. Click "Close Period" button → 5 seconds
2. System automatically:
   - Validates all transactions posted ✅
   - Creates snapshots for all items ✅
   - Calculates period costs ✅
   - Generates closing entries ✅
   - Updates period status ✅
   - Emails reports to stakeholders ✅
3. Review validation report → 2 minutes
4. Click "Confirm Close" → done!
```

**Time Savings**: 87% reduction (4 hours → <5 minutes)

**Training Required**: 2-hour session covering:
- New period close workflow
- Validation report review
- Re-open procedures (if needed)
- Lock period procedures

---

### Q19: Can I still manually enter lot numbers after Phase 2?

**A**: **Yes, manual entry remains available**:

**Phase 2 Options**:
- ✅ **Automatic** (recommended): Click "Generate" → system creates lot number
- ✅ **Manual** (allowed): Type lot number manually if preferred
- ✅ **Mixed** (flexible): Use automatic for most, manual for exceptions

**Why Allow Manual?**:
- Special circumstances may require custom lot numbers
- Transition period flexibility
- User preference accommodation

**Validation** (Phase 2):
- All lot numbers (auto or manual) validated against format: `^[A-Z]{2,4}-\d{6}-\d{4}$`
- Duplicate prevention regardless of entry method
- Format enforcement ensures consistency

**Recommendation**: Transition to automatic generation over 1-2 months to eliminate errors completely.

---

### Q20: What if I need to post a transaction to a closed period?

**A**: Re-open procedure (Phase 4):

**Re-Open Process**:
```
1. Request Re-Open:
   - Submit reason for late posting
   - Provide transaction details
   - Attach supporting documents

2. System Re-Opens Period:
   - Status: CLOSED → OPEN
   - Post late transaction
   - System recalculates affected balances

3. Re-Close Period:
   - Updated snapshots created
   - Reports regenerated
   - Period re-closed
```

**Recalculation**: Automatic (instant)
**Audit Trail**: Complete (reason, timestamp)

**Best Practice**: Minimize re-opens through improved transaction posting discipline. Phase 4 training includes period-end checklists to reduce late postings.

---

## Finance & Compliance Questions

### Q21: Will historical financial reports change?

**A**: **No, historical reports remain accurate**:

**Historical Data** (past periods):
- ✅ Calculations unchanged
- ✅ Reports remain accurate
- ✅ Audit trail preserved
- ✅ No recalculation of closed periods

**Future Data** (new transactions):
- ✅ Enhanced features apply
- ✅ Better traceability
- ✅ Improved accuracy

**Phase 4 Impact**:
- ✅ Historical reports become **faster** (<1 second vs 5+ seconds)
- ✅ Snapshots preserve period-end data permanently
- ✅ Period-to-period comparisons guaranteed accurate

**Compliance**: All enhancements maintain full audit trail and compliance with accounting standards.

---

### Q22: How does period locking affect audit compliance?

**A**: **Significantly improves** audit compliance:

**Current Compliance** (v1.0):
- ⚠️ Risk of backdated changes
- ⚠️ Historical data can be recalculated differently
- ⚠️ No enforcement of period boundaries
- ⚠️ Manual export/archive required

**Future Compliance** (v2.0):
- ✅ **Locked Period** = permanent historical record
- ✅ No backdated changes possible (enforced by system)
- ✅ Snapshots preserve exact period-end data
- ✅ Complete audit trail with timestamps

**Period States**:
```
OPEN → Transactions allowed
CLOSED → No new transactions, can re-open
LOCKED → Permanently frozen, cannot re-open
```

**Audit Benefits**:
- ✅ Guarantees data integrity
- ✅ Prevents manipulation
- ✅ Maintains complete history
- ✅ Supports external audit requirements

**Recommendation**: Lock periods after external audit completion (typically 3 months after close).

---

### Q23: Can we use both FIFO and Periodic Average methods?

**A**: **One method company-wide** (by design):

**Current Policy** (v1.0 and v2.0):
- ✅ Select one method for entire company
- ✅ Switch methods at period boundaries
- ✅ Consistent application across all locations

**Why Single Method?**:
- Accounting standards require consistency
- Financial reporting must be comparable
- Auditors require uniform application
- Tax regulations mandate consistent methodology

**Method Comparison**:

**FIFO** (First-In-First-Out):
- Best for: Perishable goods, high price volatility
- Matching: Physical flow of inventory
- Complexity: Higher (track individual lot costs)
- Accuracy: Precise cost of goods sold

**Periodic Average**:
- Best for: Stable prices, commodity items
- Matching: Simplified financial reporting
- Complexity: Lower (single average cost per period)
- Accuracy: Good for stable-price items

**Recommendation**: Consult with your finance team and auditors before changing costing methods.

---

### Q24: How often should we lock periods?

**A**: Recommended timeline based on business cycle:

**Typical Schedule**:
```
Month-End (Day 1-2):
- Close period automatically (<5 minutes)
- Review validation reports
- Generate month-end financials

Week After Close (Day 5-7):
- Internal financial review
- Reconciliation with general ledger
- Any re-opens if needed

Month After Close (Day 30-40):
- External audit (if applicable)
- Final review of period results
- **LOCK PERIOD** (permanent freeze)
```

**Lock Triggers**:
- ✅ External audit completion
- ✅ Financial statements approved
- ✅ Tax reporting finalized
- ✅ No further changes expected

**Best Practice**: Lock periods 2-3 months after close, once all reviews and audits are complete.

**Exception**: Some companies may lock immediately after close for strict financial control (more restrictive, requires disciplined posting).

---

### Q25: What is period-end revaluation and why is it important?

**A**: Period-end revaluation is an automated process for Periodic Average costing that standardizes inventory costs at period close:

**Purpose**: Ensure period-to-period cost consistency and accurate financial reporting

**How It Works**:
1. **During Period**: Receipts recorded at **actual costs** (no revaluation yet)
2. **Period Close**: System calculates **final period average** from all receipts
3. **CLOSE Transaction**: Revalues ending inventory to period average cost
4. **Diff Variance**: Calculates and posts variance to P&L revaluation account
5. **OPEN Transaction**: Creates opening balance for next period at period average

**Example**:
```
January 2025 Receipts:
- 100 kg @ $10.00 = $1,000
- 150 kg @ $12.00 = $1,800
- 200 kg @ $11.00 = $2,200
Period Average = $5,000 / 450 kg = $11.11/kg

Ending Inventory: 250 kg
- Book Value at Actual Costs: $2,750.00
- Revalued Amount (250 × $11.11): $2,777.50
- Diff Variance: $27.50 (posted to P&L)

Next Period (February):
- Opens with 250 kg @ $11.11/kg (standardized)
- Clean slate for February calculations
```

**Business Value**:
- ✅ **Consistent Costs**: Period-to-period inventory at consistent average
- ✅ **Accurate Reporting**: Simplified reconciliation and comparison
- ✅ **Automated Variance**: No manual journal entries needed
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete revaluation history preserved

---

### Q26: How does the Diff column work in revaluation?

**A**: The Diff column tracks revaluation variance and rounding differences:

**Two Components**:

**1. Revaluation Variance** (period-end):
```
Diff = (Period Average × Remaining Qty) - Book Value at Actual Costs

Example:
- Remaining Qty: 250 kg
- Period Average: $11.11/kg
- Book Value at Actual: $2,750.00
- Revalued Amount: 250 × $11.11 = $2,777.50
- Diff: $2,777.50 - $2,750.00 = $27.50
```

**2. Rounding Differences** (precision handling):
```
Price Precision: 2 decimal display, 5 decimal storage (DECIMAL(20,5))
Qty Precision: 3 decimal display, 5 decimal storage

Example:
- Actual calculation: 100 kg × $33.33333 = $3,333.333
- Displayed: 100 kg × $33.33 = $3,333.00
- Diff: $0.33 (rounding difference)
```

**Where Diff Is Posted**:
- **Account**: Revaluation Variance (P&L account)
- **Timing**: At period close, as part of CLOSE transaction
- **Journal Entry**: Automated, no manual posting needed
- **Reporting**: Shown in revaluation variance reports

**Sign Convention**:
- **Positive Diff**: Inventory value increased (debit inventory, credit variance account)
- **Negative Diff**: Inventory value decreased (credit inventory, debit variance account)

### Q27: When does revaluation happen and can I disable it?

**A**: Revaluation timing and configuration options:

**When Revaluation Happens**:
- **Trigger**: Period close operation (end of month)
- **Costing Method**: Only for **Periodic Average** (not FIFO)
- **Frequency**: Once per period (monthly)
- **Duration**: <5 minutes (automated)
- **Transaction Types**: Creates CLOSE and OPEN transactions

**Configuration Options**:
```json
{
  "costing_method": "PERIODIC_AVERAGE",
  "enable_revaluation": true   // Can be toggled
}
```

**Can You Disable Revaluation?**:
- ✅ **Yes**, but not recommended for Periodic Average
- ⚠️ Without revaluation: Period-to-period costs will vary
- ⚠️ Manual journal entries required for cost standardization
- ✅ FIFO method does not use revaluation (uses actual lot costs)

**Recommended Configuration**:
- **Periodic Average**: `enable_revaluation: true` (standardize costs)
- **FIFO**: `enable_revaluation: false` (not applicable, uses actual lot costs)

**Impact of Disabling**:
- ❌ Ending inventory remains at mixed actual costs
- ❌ Next period opens at mixed costs (inconsistent)
- ❌ Manual reconciliation required
- ❌ Period-to-period comparisons more complex
- ✅ Variance still tracked in movement reports (but not posted)

### Q28: How does revaluation affect my financial statements?

**A**: Revaluation impacts balance sheet and P&L:

**Balance Sheet Impact**:
```
Before Revaluation (at actual costs):
Inventory Asset: $2,750.00

After Revaluation (at period average):
Inventory Asset: $2,777.50
Net Change: +$27.50
```

**P&L Impact**:
```
Revaluation Variance (P&L Account):
- Account: 5100-Revaluation-Variance
- Amount: $27.50 credit (if inventory increased)
- Period: January 2025
- Nature: Non-operating income/expense
```

**Financial Reporting**:
- ✅ **COGS**: Not affected (uses period average for consumption)
- ✅ **Gross Margin**: Consistent period-to-period
- ✅ **Inventory Value**: Standardized at period average
- ✅ **Variance Account**: Separate line item in P&L

**Example P&L Extract**:
```
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)        $87,650.00
Gross Margin                     $112,350.00
Operating Expenses               ($45,000.00)
Operating Income                  $67,350.00

Other Income/(Expense):
Revaluation Variance                  $27.50  ← Appears here
Net Income                        $67,377.50
```

**Audit Considerations**:
- ✅ Clearly disclosed as revaluation variance
- ✅ Complete audit trail with journal entries
- ✅ Reconcilable to movement reports
- ✅ Complies with accounting standards (IAS 2, GAAP)
