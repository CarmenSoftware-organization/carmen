### Cost Calculation Algorithm

**FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**:
1. Retrieve all cost layers for inventory item ordered by creation date ASC
2. For issue quantity, consume cost layers in order until quantity fulfilled
3. Update remaining quantity for each cost layer
4. Calculate total cost = Σ(quantity_consumed × cost_per_unit)

**Periodic Average**:
1. Calculate period average: (opening_value + receipt_value) ÷ (opening_qty + receipt_qty)
2. Apply average cost to all issues in period
3. Update average cost at period close
```

**When to Read**:

**Example Content**:
```
### UC-PRO-001: Create Purchase Request

**Actor**: Purchasing Staff
**Preconditions**:
- User is authenticated
- User has permission to create purchase requests
- User's department is active

**Main Flow**:
1. User navigates to Purchase Requests
2. User clicks "New Purchase Request"
3. System displays empty form
4. User enters request date
5. User selects products and quantities
6. System calculates total amount
7. User adds notes (optional)
8. User clicks "Save as Draft" OR "Submit for Approval"
9. System validates data
10. System creates purchase request
11. System displays success message

**Alternative Flows**:
- A1: Validation fails → System shows errors, user corrects
- A2: Save as Draft → Status = DRAFT, no approval workflow triggered
- A3: Submit → Status = SUBMITTED, approval workflow triggered
```

**When to Read**:
- Understanding user workflows
- Writing tests
- User training
- Feature walkthroughs

**Example**: [UC-purchase-requests.md](../procurement/purchase-requests/UC-purchase-requests.md)
