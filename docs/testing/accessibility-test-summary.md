# Carmen ERP Accessibility Test Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive accessibility testing setup implemented for the Carmen ERP system using Playwright. The tests are designed to verify that all pages in the application are accessible and can be navigated to without errors.

## Test Implementation

### 1. Test Suite Structure

**Location**: `/tests/accessibility/page-accessibility.spec.ts`

The accessibility test suite includes:
- Comprehensive route testing across all modules
- Authentication state management
- Error detection and reporting
- Detailed accessibility metrics

### 2. Routes Tested

The test suite covers **130+ routes** across all major modules:

#### Core Application Routes
- Authentication (`/login`, `/signup`, `/signin`)
- Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- Profile management (`/profile`, `/edit-profile`)

#### Business Module Routes
- **Inventory Management** (25+ routes)
  - Physical counts, spot checks, stock overview
  - Inventory adjustments, fractional inventory
  - Stock cards, aging reports, period-end
  
- **Procurement** (20+ routes)
  - Purchase requests and orders
  - Goods received notes, credit notes
  - Vendor comparison, approvals
  
- **Vendor Management** (15+ routes)
  - Vendor profiles, pricelists, campaigns
  - Templates, portal functionality
  
- **Product Management** (8+ routes)
  - Product catalog, categories, units
  
- **Operational Planning** (10+ routes)
  - Recipe management, cuisine types, categories
  
- **Store Operations** (8+ routes)
  - Store requisitions, wastage reporting, stock replenishment
  
- **System Administration** (30+ routes)
  - User management, workflows, integrations
  - POS mapping, reports, business rules
  
- **Finance** (8+ routes)
  - Account mapping, currency management, exchange rates
  
- **Reporting & Analytics** (5+ routes)
  - Consumption analytics, operational reports

#### Dynamic Routes
The test suite also includes sample dynamic routes with mock IDs:
- Detail pages (`/procurement/purchase-requests/PR-2024-001`)
- Edit forms (`/vendor-management/vendors/vendor-001/edit`)
- Configuration pages (`/system-administration/workflow/workflow-configuration/workflow-001`)

### 3. Test Features

#### Authentication Simulation
```typescript
async function mockAuthentication(page: Page) {
  await page.addInitScript(() => {
    localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify({
      id: 'test-user-001',
      name: 'Test User',
      email: 'test@example.com',
      role: 'staff',
      department: 'procurement',
      location: 'main-kitchen',
      permissions: ['read', 'write', 'approve']
    }));
    
    localStorage.setItem('isAuthenticated', 'true');
    localStorage.setItem('selectedBusinessUnit', 'main-unit');
  });
}
```

#### Error Detection
The test suite detects multiple types of errors:
- HTTP status codes (4xx, 5xx)
- Error text indicators ("Error", "404")
- Next.js error boundaries
- Application error pages

#### Accessibility Validation
```typescript
async function checkPageAccessibility(page: Page, route: string) {
  // Navigate with proper timeout and wait conditions
  const response = await page.goto(route, { 
    waitUntil: 'networkidle',
    timeout: 30000 
  });
  
  // Check for error indicators
  const hasErrorText = await page.locator('text=Error').count() > 0;
  const has404Text = await page.locator('text=404').count() > 0;
  const hasErrorPage = await page.locator('[data-testid="error-page"]').count() > 0;
  const hasNextError = await page.locator('text=Application error').count() > 0;
  
  // Determine accessibility status
  return {
    url: route,
    accessible: response?.ok() && !hasErrorText && !has404Text && !hasErrorPage && !hasNextError,
    statusCode: response?.status(),
    redirected: finalUrl !== expectedUrl,
    finalUrl: redirected ? finalUrl : undefined,
  };
}
```

### 4. Test Categories

#### Public Routes
Routes that should be accessible without authentication:
- Landing page, login, signup pages
- Public documentation or help pages

#### Protected Routes
Routes requiring authentication:
- Dashboard, all business modules
- User profile and settings
- Administrative functions

#### Special Routes
Routes with expected redirect behavior:
- Root path (`/`) - may redirect to login or dashboard
- Business unit selector - may redirect if already selected

#### Dynamic Routes
Routes with parameter placeholders:
- Detail pages with specific IDs
- Edit forms with entity references
- Configuration pages with workflow IDs

### 5. Reporting Features

#### Real-time Console Logging
```
‚úÖ Public route /login is accessible
‚ùå Protected route /invalid-route is not accessible: HTTP 404
üîÑ Redirected routes: / ‚Üí /dashboard
```

#### Detailed JSON Report
Generated at `test-results/accessibility-report.json`:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-22T05:30:00.000Z",
  "summary": {
    "total": 130,
    "accessible": 125,
    "inaccessible": 3,
    "redirected": 2,
    "successRate": "96.15%"
  },
  "results": [...]
}
```

## Configuration

### Playwright Configuration
**File**: `playwright.config.js`

Key settings for accessibility testing:
- Base URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Single worker for consistent results
- Extended timeouts for complex pages
- Network idle wait condition
- Screenshot capture on failures

### Test Execution

#### Run Accessibility Tests
```bash
# Run all accessibility tests
npx playwright test tests/accessibility/page-accessibility.spec.ts

# Run on specific browser
npx playwright test tests/accessibility/page-accessibility.spec.ts --project=desktop-chrome

# Run with detailed output
npx playwright test tests/accessibility/page-accessibility.spec.ts --reporter=line
```

#### View Results
