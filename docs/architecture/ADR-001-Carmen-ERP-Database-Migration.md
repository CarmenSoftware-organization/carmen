# ADR-001: Carmen ERP Database Migration and Enterprise Architecture Implementation

## Status
**Accepted** - Implementation Complete (December 2024)

## Context

Carmen ERP was initially developed as a hospitality-focused Enterprise Resource Planning system with mock data for rapid prototyping. The system needed to transition to a production-ready architecture with:

1. **Database Integration**: Replace mock data with PostgreSQL database using Prisma ORM
2. **Enterprise Authentication**: Implement Keycloak-based identity management 
3. **Scalable Services**: Create production-ready service layer with caching and performance optimization
4. **Comprehensive API Layer**: RESTful APIs with security, validation, and monitoring
5. **Modern Frontend Integration**: React Query-based data fetching with error handling
6. **Observability**: Monitoring, logging, and analytics for production operations

## Decision

We decided to implement a comprehensive migration from mock data to a full-scale enterprise architecture with the following components:

### 1. Database Architecture
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Schema**: 68 tables covering all hospitality ERP domains
- **Patterns**: Domain-driven design with clear service boundaries
- **Performance**: Connection pooling, query optimization, and caching layers

### 2. Authentication & Authorization  
- **Primary System**: Keycloak OIDC/OAuth2 integration
- **Migration Strategy**: Hybrid approach supporting both JWT (legacy) and Keycloak
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control with 8 hierarchical permission levels
- **Security**: Comprehensive audit logging, threat detection, and input validation

### 3. Service Layer Architecture
- **Pattern**: Domain service pattern with centralized business logic
- **Services Implemented**:
  - Vendor Management Service (with supplier performance tracking)
  - Product Management Service (with inventory integration) 
  - Procurement Services (Purchase Requests & Orders with workflow management)
  - Inventory Management Services (with ABC analysis and demand forecasting)
  - Financial Calculation Services (with multiple costing methods)
- **Caching**: Redis-based caching with in-memory fallback
- **Performance**: Optimistic updates, batch operations, pagination

### 4. API Architecture
- **Standard**: RESTful APIs following OpenAPI specifications
- **Security**: Keycloak authentication with granular permissions
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for input validation and type safety
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with security event logging
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limits per endpoint and user role

### 5. Frontend Architecture  
- **Data Fetching**: React Query for server state management
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with Keycloak provider
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries with user-friendly recovery
- **UI**: Shadcn/ui components with accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- **Performance**: Optimistic updates, skeleton loading, and intelligent caching

### 6. Observability & Monitoring
- **APM**: Application Performance Monitoring with Core Web Vitals
- **Logging**: Structured logging with error aggregation
- **Metrics**: Business KPIs and system health monitoring
- **Alerting**: Multi-channel notifications with escalation policies
- **Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring dashboard for system operators

## Implementation Details

### Database Migration
```typescript
// Prisma schema with 68 tables
model User {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  keycloakId   String?  @unique
  email        String   @unique
  // ... 40+ fields with relationships
}
```

### Service Architecture
```typescript
// Domain service pattern
class VendorService {
  async createVendor(data: CreateVendorInput): Promise<ServiceResult<Vendor>> {
    // Validation, business logic, caching, audit logging
  }
}
```

### Authentication Integration  
```typescript
// Hybrid authentication strategy
const authStrategy = {
  keycloak: NextAuth with Keycloak provider,
  jwt: Legacy JWT support,
  rbac: 8-level role hierarchy
}
```

### API Security
```typescript
// Unified authentication middleware
export const GET = authStrategies.hybrid(async (request, { user }) => {
  // Role-based access control
  // Input validation
  // Audit logging
  // Rate limiting
})
```

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes

1. **Production Readiness**: System ready for enterprise deployment
2. **Scalability**: Architecture supports horizontal scaling and high availability  
3. **Security**: Enterprise-grade security with Keycloak and comprehensive auditing
4. **Performance**: Significant performance improvements through caching and optimization

## Alternative Considerations

### Rejected Alternatives

1. **Supabase**: Rejected in favor of Prisma + PostgreSQL for better control and customization
2. **Auth0**: Rejected in favor of Keycloak for cost-effectiveness and self-hosting capability
3. **GraphQL**: Rejected in favor of REST for team familiarity and ecosystem maturity
4. **Microservices**: Rejected in favor of modular monolith for initial deployment simplicity

### Future Considerations

1. **Microservices Migration**: Possible future transition for scale
2. **Event Sourcing**: Consider for audit-heavy domains
3. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket integration for live updates
4. **Mobile Applications**: React Native or native mobile apps
