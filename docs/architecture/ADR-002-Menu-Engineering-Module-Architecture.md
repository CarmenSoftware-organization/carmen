# ADR-002: Menu Engineering Module Architecture

**Status**: Implemented  
**Date**: December 2024  
**Decision Makers**: Carmen ERP Architecture Team  
**Stakeholders**: Restaurant Operations, Finance, IT Operations

---

## Summary

Implementation of a comprehensive Menu Engineering Module for Carmen ERP that leverages existing recipe infrastructure to provide Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix analysis, AI-powered recommendations, and data-driven menu optimization capabilities.

---

## Context

### Business Problem
Restaurants struggle with menu optimization, often relying on intuition rather than data to make critical decisions about pricing, placement, and menu composition. Without scientific analysis, restaurants:
- Lose 15-30% potential profit through suboptimal menu engineering
- Cannot identify underperforming items (Dogs) or high-potential items (Puzzles)
- Lack visibility into real-time cost variations and their impact on profitability
- Miss opportunities to optimize high-volume, low-margin items (Plowhorses)

### Technical Context
Carmen ERP already possessed sophisticated recipe management infrastructure with:
- Comprehensive recipe costing data (`costPerPortion`, `sellingPrice`, `grossMargin`)
- Category hierarchy with cost settings and margins
- Yield variants for portion control
- Ingredient cost tracking and inventory integration

### Constraints
- Must leverage existing recipe infrastructure (60-70% development savings)
- Implementation timeline: 5-7 weeks for MVP
- Integration required with existing Keycloak authentication
- Performance requirements: <200ms API responses, dashboard loading <3s

---

## Decision

We decided to implement a Menu Engineering Module with the following architectural approach:

### 1. Leverage Existing Infrastructure
**Decision**: Build upon existing recipe management system rather than creating parallel structures.

**Rationale**:
- Existing recipes contain comprehensive financial data needed for menu engineering
- Reduces implementation time from 12-16 weeks to 5-7 weeks
- Ensures data consistency and eliminates synchronization issues
- Maintains single source of truth for recipe costs and margins

### 2. Four-Layer Architecture
**Decision**: Implement a clean, layered architecture following Carmen ERP patterns.

#### Layer 1: Database Extensions
- **New Tables**: `tb_sales_transactions`, `tb_menu_analyses`
- **Integration**: Foreign key relationships to existing `recipes` table
- **Performance**: Materialized views and automated scoring functions
- **Optimization**: Strategic indexing for analytical workloads

#### Layer 2: Service Layer
- **POS Integration Service**: Handles sales data import and mapping
- **Analytics Service**: Implements BCG matrix classification algorithms
- **Enhanced Costing Service**: Real-time cost calculations and alerting
- **Integration Service**: Orchestrates multi-service operations

#### Layer 3: API Layer
- **RESTful Design**: Following Carmen ERP's existing patterns
- **Security**: Keycloak authentication with role-based access
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI 3.0 specification with comprehensive examples
- **Performance**: Caching, rate limiting, and pagination

#### Layer 4: Frontend Components
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Scatter plot visualization with BCG matrix quadrants
- **Data Import Interface**: Multi-step wizard with POS system integration
- **Alert Management**: Real-time cost monitoring and threshold configuration
- **Mobile Responsive**: WCAG 2.1 AA accessible design

### 3. Boston Consulting Group Matrix Implementation
**Decision**: Use industry-standard BCG matrix for menu item classification.

**Classification Logic**:
```
Stars:       High popularity (≥50) + High profitability (≥50) → Promote and maintain
Plowhorses:  High popularity (≥50) + Low profitability (<50)  → Increase prices or reduce costs
Puzzles:     Low popularity (<50) + High profitability (≥50) → Increase marketing
Dogs:        Low popularity (<50) + Low profitability (<50)  → Consider removing
```

### 4. Real-Time Cost Integration
**Decision**: Integrate with existing inventory system for real-time cost calculations.

**Benefits**:
- Automatic cost updates when ingredient prices change
- Proactive alerts when profit margins fall below thresholds
- Dynamic pricing recommendations based on current costs
- Variance tracking and trend analysis

## Implementation Details

### Database Architecture

#### Sales Transactions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE tb_sales_transactions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    recipe_id UUID REFERENCES recipes(id),
    sale_date TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    quantity_sold DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    revenue DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    -- Additional context fields...
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Menu Analysis Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE tb_menu_analyses (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    recipe_id UUID REFERENCES recipes(id),
    analysis_date TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    popularity_score DECIMAL(5,2), -- 0-100 scale
    profitability_score DECIMAL(5,2), -- 0-100 scale
    classification menu_classification_enum NOT NULL,
    recommendations JSONB,
    -- Performance metrics...
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Composite Indexes**: `(recipe_id, sale_date)` for time-series queries
- **Materialized Views**: Pre-calculated 30-day rolling performance summaries
- **Automated Functions**: `calculate_menu_engineering_scores()` for consistent scoring

### Service Layer Architecture

#### Base Calculator Pattern
All services extend `BaseCalculator` for consistent:
- Error handling and logging
- Redis caching with intelligent invalidation
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Audit trail and calculation traceability

#### Analytics Engine
```typescript
class MenuEngineeringAnalyticsService extends BaseCalculator {
  async classifyMenuItems(options: AnalysisOptions): Promise<MenuClassification[]> {
    // BCG matrix classification logic
    const popularityScore = await this.calculatePopularityScore(recipe);
    const profitabilityScore = await this.calculateProfitabilityScore(recipe);
    
    return this.determineClassification(popularityScore, profitabilityScore);
  }
}
```

### API Design

#### RESTful Endpoints
- **Analytics**: `GET /api/menu-engineering/analysis`
- **Classifications**: `GET /api/menu-engineering/classification`
- **Sales Import**: `POST /api/menu-engineering/sales/import`
- **Real-time Costs**: `GET /api/recipes/{id}/real-time-cost`

#### Security Implementation
- **Authentication**: Keycloak JWT validation
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable limits per endpoint and role
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive Zod schemas with threat detection

### Frontend Architecture

#### Component Structure
```

- Maintainable by existing development team

### 4. API Authentication: Extend Existing Keycloak
**Options Considered**:
- A: Create separate authentication for menu engineering
- B: Use existing Keycloak integration

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Event-Driven Cost Updates
```typescript
// Inventory cost change triggers menu cost recalculation
onInventoryPriceChange(productId: string) {
  const affectedRecipes = await this.findRecipesUsingProduct(productId);
  await this.recalculateRecipeCosts(affectedRecipes);
  await this.checkCostAlertThresholds(affectedRecipes);
}
```

### 2. Materialized View Pattern
```sql
-- Pre-calculated performance summary for dashboard
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_menu_performance_summary AS
SELECT 
  r.id,
  r.name,
  AVG(ma.popularity_score) as avg_popularity,
  AVG(ma.profitability_score) as avg_profitability,
  ma.classification
FROM recipes r
JOIN menu_analyses ma ON r.id = ma.recipe_id
WHERE ma.analysis_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY r.id, r.name, ma.classification;
```

### 3. Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- **Commands**: Sales data import, cost updates, configuration changes
- **Queries**: Dashboard data, reports, analysis results
- **Separation**: Optimized data structures for each use case
