5. `/store-operations/wastage-reporting` - Wastage dashboard

## Technical Notes

### Capture Process
1. **Initial Attempt:** First script captured 8/12 requested screenshots
   - Comments, Attachments, Activity Log tabs not found
   - Reason: These tabs are not implemented in current version

2. **Investigation:** Analyzed component structure
   - Found actual tab implementation in `store-requisition-detail.tsx`
   - Identified 4 tabs: Items, Stock Movements, Journal Entries, Approval Workflow

3. **Second Attempt:** Updated script to capture correct tabs
   - Successfully captured all 4 existing tabs
   - Removed duplicate screenshots

### Challenges Encountered
- ❌ Comments tab - Not implemented
- ❌ Attachments tab - Not implemented
- ❌ Activity Log tab - Not implemented
- ✅ All other features captured successfully

### Wait Strategies Used
- `networkidle` wait after navigation
- 1-2 second delays after interactions
- `waitForTimeout` for tab transitions
- Full page screenshot mode for complete content capture

## Files Generated

### Documentation
1. `SCREENSHOT-SUMMARY.md` - Detailed screenshot documentation with descriptions
2. `README.md` - Module overview and documentation index
3. `index.html` - Interactive screenshot gallery
4. `CAPTURE-LOG.md` - This capture session log

### Screenshots (10 files)
- All stored in `/docs/documents/store-ops/`
- Naming convention: `{module}-{section}-{view}.png`
- Total size: ~2.0 MB

## Script Details

### Version 1 (Initial Capture)
- **File:** `capture-store-ops-screenshots.js`
- **Lines:** ~150
- **Screenshots:** 8 successful, 3 skipped
- **Execution Time:** ~45 seconds

### Version 2 (Tab Capture)
- **File:** `capture-store-ops-screenshots-v2.js`
- **Lines:** ~90
- **Screenshots:** 4 successful
- **Execution Time:** ~20 seconds

## Validation Checklist

- ✅ All dashboard pages captured
- ✅ Both list view layouts (table + card) captured
- ✅ Filter dialog captured
- ✅ All implemented detail tabs captured
- ✅ Full page content visible
- ✅ High quality resolution (1920x1080)
- ✅ Proper naming conventions
- ✅ Documentation created
- ✅ Interactive gallery created
- ✅ Temporary scripts cleaned up

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- ✅ Clean up temporary screenshot scripts
- ✅ Create comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Build interactive gallery

### Future Enhancements
- 📋 Add mobile viewport screenshots (375x667, 768x1024)
- 📋 Capture empty states and error states
- 📋 Record video walkthroughs of user flows
- 📋 Add Comments, Attachments, Activity Log tabs (when implemented)
- 📋 Capture loading states and transitions
- 📋 Add user interaction flows

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify component structure** before creating screenshot scripts
2. **Tab implementations may differ** from requirements/specifications
3. **Use incremental approach** - capture what exists, document what doesn't
4. **Clean up artifacts** - remove temporary scripts after successful capture
5. **Create multiple documentation formats** - markdown, HTML, logs for different use cases
