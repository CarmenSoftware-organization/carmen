# Feature: Procurement Management System

## Description
The Carmen ERP Procurement Management System provides a comprehensive end-to-end procurement workflow encompassing Purchase Requests, Purchase Orders, Goods Received Notes, Credit Notes, and My Approvals. The system features a sophisticated workflow engine with role-based approvals, vendor comparison capabilities, multi-level item management with pricing transparency controls, and integrated inventory tracking. The procurement process supports both manual entry and automated creation from templates, with real-time status tracking and document lifecycle management.

## Process Flow (Step by Step)

### Purchase Request Flow
1. User navigates to `/procurement/purchase-requests` to view existing requests or create new ones
2. System displays ModernPurchaseRequestList with filtering, sorting, and status-based organization
3. User can create new PR via "New PR" button or from templates
4. PR creation form loads with tabs: Items, Details, Budgets, Workflow, Attachments
5. User adds items using ItemsTab component with search functionality and vendor comparison
6. System applies role-based pricing visibility (user.context.showPrices controls price display)
7. Workflow engine determines approval routing based on business rules and user roles
8. PR submits for approval and enters workflow status tracking
9. Approvers receive notifications and can view/approve via My Approvals section
10. Upon approval, PR can be converted to Purchase Order automatically or manually

### Purchase Order Flow
11. Approved PRs convert to POs via `/procurement/purchase-orders/create/from-pr` workflow
12. PO creation supports bulk operations and vendor consolidation
13. PO tabs include: Items, Vendor Info, Financial Details, Related Documents, Activity Log
14. System tracks PO status: Draft, Sent, Acknowledged, Partially Received, Completed
15. Vendor receives PO and can update delivery schedules via vendor portal integration

### Goods Received Note Flow
16. Users create GRN from `/procurement/goods-received-note/new` with vendor/PO selection
17. GRN creation wizard: PO Selection → Item Selection → Location Assignment → Confirmation
18. System supports manual entry mode for non-PO receipts
19. GRN tabs manage: Items, Stock Movement, Extra Costs, Tax, Financial Summary, Comments
20. Stock movements automatically update inventory levels upon GRN completion
21. System generates journal entries for accounting integration
