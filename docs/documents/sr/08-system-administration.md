# Feature: System Administration

## Description
The Carmen ERP System Administration module provides comprehensive system management capabilities including user management, permission management, workflow configuration, location management, system integrations (particularly POS integration), and business rule configuration. The system features advanced role-based policy management, sophisticated workflow engines, location hierarchy management, and extensive integration capabilities. System administration supports both simple and complex organizational structures with scalable permission models and workflow configurations.

## Process Flow (Step by Step)

### User Management
1. User navigates to `/system-administration/user-management` to access user administration
2. System displays user list with filtering by role, department, status, and search functionality
3. Administrator can create new users, edit existing profiles, or manage user assignments
4. User creation includes personal information, role assignments, department access, and location permissions
5. Bulk user operations support mass role updates, status changes, and permission assignments
6. User activity monitoring provides audit trails and access tracking
7. User lifecycle management handles activation, deactivation, and profile archival

### Permission Management
8. Administrator accesses `/system-administration/permission-management` for advanced permission control
9. Policy Management allows creation of custom access policies with complex business rules
10. Role Management provides hierarchical role definition with permission inheritance
11. Subscription Settings manage feature access based on licensing and subscription levels
12. Policy Builder enables visual policy creation with conditional logic and rule testing
13. Permission assignment supports both individual user and group-based permissions
14. Policy validation ensures conflict resolution and logical consistency

### Workflow Configuration
15. Workflow Management accessible via `/system-administration/workflow/workflow-configuration`
16. Workflow designer allows creation of approval workflows with multiple stages and routing
17. Role Assignment component manages approver assignments based on organizational hierarchy
18. Conditional routing supports complex approval logic based on amounts, departments, and request types
19. Workflow templates provide standardized approval processes across different document types
20. Escalation management handles overdue approvals with automatic escalation rules

### Location Management
21. Location hierarchy managed through `/system-administration/location-management`
22. Location creation includes physical address, operational parameters, and parent-child relationships
23. Location types support warehouses, stores, kitchens, offices, and virtual locations
24. Location assignments affect inventory visibility, user access, and operational scope
25. Location-specific configurations include currency, time zones, and local regulations
26. Bulk location operations support organizational restructuring and mass updates

### System Integrations
27. POS Integration accessible via `/system-administration/system-integrations/pos`
28. Integration dashboard provides real-time status monitoring and configuration management
29. Data mapping between Carmen ERP and POS systems for products, units, locations, and recipes
30. Transaction synchronization with bi-directional data flow and conflict resolution
31. Settings management for API endpoints, authentication, and data transformation rules
32. Integration monitoring with error logging, retry mechanisms, and failure alerts
