![Production Dashboard](./screenshots/production-dashboard.png)
*The Production Dashboard provides real-time production monitoring with 6 customizable drag-and-drop widgets powered by react-beautiful-dnd. Key visualizations include: Production Volume (7-day line chart showing Mon-Sun production trends from 500-900 units), Quality Control Results (pie chart displaying 92% Passed, 6% Minor Issues, 2% Failed), and Top 5 Recipes Produced (bar chart ranking Recipe A-E by production count). Three text metric widgets display Batch Production (3 batches currently in production), Wastage Tracking (2.5% production wastage this week), and Equipment Utilization (85% average utilization rate). The dashboard uses Recharts for data visualization and features responsive grid layout (1 column mobile, 2 columns tablet, 3 columns desktop) for comprehensive production operations management.*
