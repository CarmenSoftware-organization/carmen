## Recommendations

### Update Documentation
1. **Mark gaps clearly** in all HTML index pages
2. **Add roadmap section** for planned features
3. **Update statistics** in main index.html to reflect actual implementation
4. **Add feature status badges** to all feature cards

### Fix Inconsistencies
1. **Operational Planning** - Mark demand forecasting and inventory planning as "Planned" not "Available"
2. **Reporting** - Clarify if dashboard sub-route is needed or if main page is sufficient
3. **Update coverage percentages** to reflect actual implementation vs. documentation

### Navigation Updates
1. **Disable gap features** in navigation (gray out, no links)
2. **Add tooltips** explaining feature status
3. **Create unified index pages** for all modules
4. **Convert all .md links to .html**
