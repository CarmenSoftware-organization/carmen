#### Product Dashboard
![Product Dashboard](./screenshots/product-dashboard.png)
*The Product Management dashboard provides a simple entry point to the product management system. This placeholder interface is prepared for future enhancement with draggable analytics widgets, product performance metrics, and quick action buttons for common product operations.*

#### Products List
![Products List](./screenshots/products-list.png)
*The Products list interface displays 8 diverse products in a comprehensive table view: Organic Jasmine Rice (PRD-001, 35.5 THB), Palm Sugar (PRD-002, 45 THB), Fish Sauce Premium Grade (PRD-003, 65 THB), Dell UltraSharp Monitor (ELEC-002, 499.99 USD), Standing Desk (OFF-002, 699.99 USD, Inactive), Wireless Mouse (TECH-001, 79.99 USD), Filing Cabinet (STAT-002, 199.99 USD), and Mechanical Keyboard (TECH-002, 149.99 USD, Inactive). Each product shows detailed categorization through Category → Subcategory → Item Group hierarchy, inventory unit, base price, and status. The interface provides search functionality, advanced filters (Saved Filters, Add Filter), Import/Export/Report capabilities, Add Product button, and dual view modes (table/card) for flexible product catalog management.*

#### Categories Tree
![Categories Tree](./screenshots/categories-tree.png)
*The Product Categories tree interface displays hierarchical category management with a summary showing 2 Categories, 2 Subcategories, 3 Item Groups, and 225 Total Items. The tree structure includes: Raw Materials (Category, 150 items) containing Coffee Beans (Subcategory, 45 items) with Arabica (Item Group, 25 items) and Robusta (Item Group, 20 items) sub-groups, and Packaging (Category, 75 items) containing Cups (Subcategory, 30 items) with Paper Cups (Item Group, 15 items). The interface features search functionality, Add Category buttons at multiple levels, expandable/collapsible tree nodes, and Edit/Delete/Add actions for comprehensive three-level category hierarchy management with drag-and-drop reorganization support.*

#### Units List
![Units List](./screenshots/units-list.png)
*The Unit Management interface displays 12 units across three distinct contexts: INVENTORY units (KG - Kilogram, G - Gram, L - Liter, ML - Milliliter), ORDER units (BOX - Box, CTN - Carton, PLT - Pallet marked Inactive, BG - Bag, CASE - Case), and RECIPE units (TSP - Teaspoon, TBSP - Tablespoon, CUP - Cup). The interface provides search functionality, filters for All Status and All Types, dual view modes (table/card toggle), Export and Add Unit buttons, and detailed columns (Code, Name, Type, Status, Description, Actions) for managing the flexible multi-context unit system used across inventory, ordering, and recipe management.*

## Data Flow Patterns

### Product Lifecycle
Browse → Search/Filter → View Details → Edit → Save → Update List

### Category Management
Load Tree → Search/Navigate → Drag & Drop → Validate → Update Structure

### Filter Workflow
Basic Filters → Advanced Builder → Add Conditions → Apply Logic → Save/Load → Execute
