---

## Technical Debt and Known Issues

### Development State

**Current Architecture**: Frontend-only implementation with comprehensive mock data

**Mock Data Architecture**:
- **Strengths**: Type-safe factories, comprehensive test scenarios, realistic business data
- **Production Requirement**: Replace with actual API endpoints and database integration

### Authentication System

**Current State**: Multiple authentication routes without backend integration
- `app/(auth)/login/[[...login]]/` - Catch-all login route
- `app/(auth)/signup/` - User registration (mock)
- `app/(auth)/signin/` - Alternative signin path

**Production Requirements**:
- Integrate with authentication provider (Auth0, Clerk, custom)
- Implement session management and JWT handling
- Add password reset and email verification workflows

### Data Persistence

**Current Limitation**: No database integration
- All data stored in memory during session
- Form submissions use React Hook Form with Zod validation
- No data persistence between sessions

**Integration Requirements**:
- Database schema implementation matching TypeScript types
- API endpoint implementation for all CRUD operations
- Migration from mock data to live data with seeding capabilities
