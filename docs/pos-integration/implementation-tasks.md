## Legend
- âœ… Completed
- ðŸš§ In Progress
- â­• Not Started

## Notes
- Core features (Sections 1-3) have been implemented with basic functionality
- Advanced features and remaining sections need to be prioritized based on business requirements
- Each completed section may need refinements based on user feedback
- Integration with backend services pending for all sections (using simulation where needed)
- ComponentSearchDialog currently uses mock recipe data; needs refactoring to use actual component/inventory data source. 
- Unit conversion support relies on existing Recipe/Product modules; implementation needed in Consumption Tracking (Section 5).
