# POS Interface Requirements Specification

## 1. Overview

The Point of Sale (POS) interface provides a critical connection between the hospitality POS system and the supply chain management system. This interface enables accurate inventory tracking based on actual sales data, with automatic consumption calculations based on predefined recipe mappings.

| FU-04 | System shall provide immediate feedback on file validation results |
| FU-05 | System shall log all file upload activities with timestamp and user information |

### 2.2 API Integration

| Requirement ID | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| API-01 | System shall expose a secure API endpoint to receive POS transaction data |

| API-03 | System shall validate all data received through the API before processing |
| API-04 | System shall acknowledge receipt of data with appropriate status codes |
| API-05 | System shall log all API transactions with timestamp and source information |

## 3. Data Processing Requirements

### 3.1 Intermediate Storage

| Requirement ID | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| IS-01 | System shall maintain intermediate staging table(s) to store all incoming POS transactions |
| IS-02 | Staging tables shall preserve the original transaction data for audit purposes |
| IS-03 | System shall include fields for tracking processing status (pending, processed, error) |
| IS-04 | System shall timestamp all records upon receipt |
| IS-05 | System shall maintain referential integrity between transactions and their source |

### 3.2 Recipe Mapping

| Requirement ID | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| RM-01 | System shall maintain a mapping table between POS menu items and corresponding recipe components |
| RM-02 | System shall support one-to-many relationships between menu items and inventory items |
| RM-03 | System shall support quantity/proportion specifications for each recipe component |
| RM-04 | System shall detect and flag new POS items that lack complete recipe mappings |
| RM-05 | System shall provide an interface for supply chain users to create or update recipe mappings |

## 4. Inventory Management

### 4.1 Consumption Processing

| Requirement ID | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| CP-01 | System shall process fully mapped transactions by reducing corresponding inventory items |
| CP-02 | System shall calculate inventory reductions based on recipe proportions and transaction quantities |
| CP-03 | System shall process all transactions as "stock out" inventory movements |
| CP-04 | System shall ensure no inventory item is reduced below zero (0) quantity |
| CP-05 | System shall queue transactions that would result in negative inventory for review |

### 4.2 New Item Handling

| Requirement ID | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| NI-01 | System shall identify POS items without complete recipe mappings |
| NI-02 | System shall create temporary inventory items for unmapped POS items |
| NI-03 | System shall categorize these transactions as "stock out" type sales |
| NI-04 | System shall notify appropriate users of new unmapped items requiring attention |
| NI-05 | System shall provide a mechanism to retroactively apply proper mapping once created |

## 5. Exception Handling & Reporting

### 5.1 Processing Exceptions

| Requirement ID | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| PE-01 | System shall maintain a log of all processing exceptions |
| PE-02 | System shall categorize exceptions by type (validation errors, mapping issues, inventory constraints) |
| PE-03 | System shall provide supply chain users with a dashboard to review pending exceptions |
| PE-04 | System shall support manual resolution of exceptions with appropriate audit trail |
| PE-05 | System shall prevent duplicate processing of transactions |

### 5.2 Reporting & Analytics

| Requirement ID | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| RA-01 | System shall provide reports on transaction processing status |
| RA-02 | System shall track unmapped item frequency to prioritize mapping efforts |
| RA-03 | System shall provide consumption analysis by inventory item |
| RA-04 | System shall alert on items approaching inventory thresholds |
| RA-05 | System shall support export of transaction and exception data for further analysis |
