# Goods Received Note Creation Workflow Specification

**Module**: Procurement  
**Function**: Goods Received Notes  
**Component**: Creation Workflow  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Based on Actual Source Code Analysis

---

## Implementation Overview

**Purpose**: This workflow provides a comprehensive multi-path creation process for goods received notes, enabling users to create GRNs either from existing purchase orders or through manual entry. The workflow includes vendor selection, purchase order selection, item selection with location assignment, and final confirmation stages.

**Implementation Files**:
- Main entry: goods-received-note/page.tsx
- Vendor selection: new/vendor-selection/page.tsx
- PO selection: new/po-selection/page.tsx
- Item selection: new/item-location-selection/page.tsx
- Manual entry: new/manual-entry/page.tsx
- State management: lib/store/grn-creation.store.ts

**Current Status**: Complete workflow implementation with Zustand state management, multi-step navigation, and comprehensive data validation. Some backend integration uses mock data for development.

## Workflow Architecture

### **State Management System**
- **Store Technology**: Zustand store (`useGRNCreationStore`) for cross-page state persistence
- **Process Types**: Purchase Order-based creation ('po') and Manual creation ('manual')
- **Step Tracking**: Process selection → Vendor selection → PO selection → Item selection → Confirmation
- **Data Persistence**: Temporary GRN data stored in browser state until final submission

### **Navigation Flow Control**
- **Dynamic Routing**: URL-based navigation with mode parameters and step validation
- **Back Button Support**: Each step includes navigation back to previous steps
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic redirection to appropriate steps when required data missing
- **State Validation**: Prevents users from accessing steps without completing prerequisites

## Creation Workflows

### **Process 1: Purchase Order-Based Creation**

#### **Step 1: Process Selection**
- **Entry Point**: Goods Received Note list page dropdown menu
- **Action Trigger**: User clicks "Create from Purchase Order" 
- **Store Updates**: Sets process type to 'po' and step to 'vendor-selection'
- **Navigation**: Redirects to vendor selection page

#### **Step 2: Vendor Selection**
- **Page Location**: `/procurement/goods-received-note/new/vendor-selection`
- **Data Source**: Vendor management system (currently mock data with 3 sample vendors)
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time search by company name and business registration number
- **Selection Criteria**: Only active vendors displayed in searchable table format
- **Required Data**: Business registration number, company name
- **Validation**: Must select vendor before proceeding to next step
- **Store Updates**: Saves selected vendor object and advances to 'po-selection' step
- **Navigation**: Automatic redirect to PO selection page upon vendor selection

#### **Step 3: Purchase Order Selection**
- **Page Location**: `/procurement/goods-received-note/new/po-selection`
- **Data Filter**: Shows only Open and Partial purchase orders for selected vendor
- **Multi-Selection**: Checkbox-based selection system with select-all functionality
- **Search Features**: Filter by PO number and purchase requisition references
- **Order Information**: Displays PO number, PR references, order date, item count, status, currency, total amount
- **Item Preview**: Expandable rows showing detailed item information with base units and currencies
- **Vendor Context**: Header displays selected vendor name for confirmation
- **Validation**: Must select at least one purchase order to proceed
- **Store Updates**: Saves array of selected purchase order objects
- **Navigation**: Advances to item location selection page

#### **Step 4: Item and Location Selection**
- **Page Location**: `/procurement/goods-received-note/new/item-location-selection`
- **Data Processing**: Flattens items from all selected purchase orders into unified list
- **Location Assignment**: Assigns mock locations based on PO patterns (Main Warehouse, Store Room A, Kitchen Prep Area, Receiving Bay)
- **Location Filtering**: Badge-based location filter system with multi-select capability
- **Item Selection**: Table with checkboxes for individual item selection
- **Quantity Management**: Receiving quantity input with validation against remaining quantities
- **Unit Selection**: Dropdown for receiving units with real-time base quantity calculations
- **Amount Calculations**: Display amounts in both PO currency and base currency
- **Data Validation**: Prevents quantities exceeding remaining amounts, ensures positive values
- **Required Fields**: Selected items must have receiving quantities greater than zero
- **Search Functionality**: Filter items by name, description, or PO number
- **Store Updates**: Creates complete GRN object with all selected items and calculated totals
- **Navigation**: Redirects to detail page with confirmation mode

#### **Step 5: Confirmation and Finalization**
- **Page Location**: `/procurement/goods-received-note/[tempId]?mode=confirm`
- **Display Format**: Full GRN detail page showing all collected information
- **Data Source**: Temporary GRN object stored in Zustand state
- **User Actions**: Review, edit, save, or cancel the created GRN
- **Final Processing**: Save triggers permanent data storage and generates final GRN reference

### **Process 2: Manual Creation**

#### **Step 1: Process Selection**
- **Entry Point**: Goods Received Note list page dropdown menu  
- **Action Trigger**: User clicks "Create Manually"
- **Data Generation**: Creates temporary GRN ID and placeholder data structure
- **Store Updates**: Sets process type to 'manual' and creates initial GRN data
- **Navigation**: Directly redirects to detail page in confirmation mode

#### **Alternative Manual Entry Path**
- **Page Location**: `/procurement/goods-received-note/new/manual-entry`
- **Form Structure**: Header section for GRN details and table section for items
- **Header Fields**: Vendor selection (dropdown), reference number, date picker, remarks textarea
- **Item Management**: Dynamic table with add/remove capabilities for items
- **Item Fields**: Name (with lookup), description, quantity, unit, location, unit price
- **Data Validation**: Required fields marked with asterisks, prevents submission with incomplete data
- **Calculation Logic**: Automatic calculation of amounts based on quantity and unit price
- **Mock Integration**: Uses mock vendor data and location options for development
- **Store Updates**: Creates complete GRN object with manual items and financial totals
- **Navigation**: Redirects to detail page with confirmation mode

## Data Flow and Transformations

### **Purchase Order Item to GRN Item Mapping**
- **Identifier Transformation**: PO item IDs mapped to temporary GRN item IDs
- **Quantity Mapping**: Ordered quantities preserved, received quantities captured separately
- **Unit Handling**: Supports different units for ordering and receiving with conversion rates
- **Currency Processing**: Maintains both PO currency and base currency amounts
- **Location Assignment**: Maps items to receiving locations with delivery point tracking
- **Financial Calculations**: Calculates subtotals, taxes, discounts, and net amounts

### **State Persistence Strategy**
- **Temporary Storage**: Uses browser-based Zustand store for cross-page state
- **Data Structure**: Complete GRN object stored before final submission
- **Session Continuity**: Maintains state during navigation and page refreshes
- **Error Recovery**: Reconstructs state from stored data if navigation issues occur

### **Validation and Error Handling**
- **Step Prerequisites**: Validates required data before allowing step progression
- **Business Rules**: Enforces quantity limits, positive values, and required field completion
- **User Feedback**: Displays clear error messages and validation states
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handles missing data with sensible defaults and user prompts
