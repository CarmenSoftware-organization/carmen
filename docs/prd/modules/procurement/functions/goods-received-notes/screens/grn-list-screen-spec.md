## Implementation Overview

**Purpose**: This screen provides a comprehensive interface for viewing, managing, and creating goods received notes (GRNs) across the organization. Users can browse all goods receipts, switch between different view modes, create new GRNs from purchase orders or manually, and perform various operations based on their role permissions.

**File Locations**: 
- Main page: goods-received-note/page.tsx
- List component: GoodsReceiveNoteList.tsx
- Data table: grn-shadcn-data-table.tsx

**User Types**: All authenticated users can access this screen, with different action capabilities based on role permissions and workflow stages.

**Current Status**: Core viewing and navigation functionality fully implemented with dual view modes, comprehensive filtering, and GRN creation workflows. Some bulk actions use placeholder implementations for backend integration.
