## Current Limitations

### **Placeholder Features**
- **Backend Integration**: All workflow actions currently log to console without permanent changes

- **History Tracking**: Item change history and audit trails use placeholder implementations
- **Split Functionality**: Item splitting feature planned but not yet implemented

### **Missing Integration**
- **Database Persistence**: Changes to items and approvals are not permanently saved
- **Live Inventory**: No connection to real-time inventory management systems
- **Vendor Pricing**: Static pricing data instead of dynamic vendor price feeds
- **Notification System**: No automated notifications for status changes or approvals

### **Known Issues**
- **Data Synchronization**: No real-time updates when multiple users edit the same request
- **Offline Capability**: No support for offline editing or conflict resolution
- **Advanced Workflows**: Complex approval routing not fully implemented
