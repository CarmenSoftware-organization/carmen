## Overview

This document defines business rules for integrating fractional sales capabilities with Point of Sale (POS) systems, ensuring seamless transactions, accurate inventory updates, and consistent customer experience across all sales channels.

**Business Context**: POS integration is critical for real-time inventory management, accurate sales tracking, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. These rules ensure fractional items are properly presented, priced, and processed through POS systems while maintaining data integrity.

## Core Business Rules

### Rule 1: Real-Time Inventory Synchronization

**Description**: Ensures POS systems display accurate fractional inventory availability in real-time to prevent overselling and maintain customer satisfaction.

**Trigger**: Inventory changes, sales transactions, conversion operations, or system synchronization events

**Business Logic**: 
- POS systems receive real-time inventory updates within 30 seconds of ERP changes
- Fractional item availability calculated dynamically based on whole items and existing portions
- Reserved inventory excluded from POS availability displays
- Out-of-stock items automatically removed from POS menus until restocked

**Validation Rules**:
- POS inventory levels never exceed actual ERP inventory by more than 1 unit
- Synchronization completion verified within 60 seconds of ERP changes
- Network connectivity failures trigger offline mode with cached inventory data
- Inventory discrepancies resolved automatically or escalated within 5 minutes

**Exception Handling**: 
- Network failures activate offline POS mode with last-known inventory levels
- Synchronization errors trigger immediate error logging and manual verification
- Oversold situations require immediate customer service intervention and compensation

### Rule 2: Dynamic Menu Management

**Description**: Manages POS menu items dynamically based on inventory availability, time of day, and operational status to optimize sales and prevent customer disappointment.

**Trigger**: Time changes, inventory level changes, operational status updates, or menu configuration changes

**Business Logic**: 
- Menu items appear/disappear based on real-time inventory availability
- Time-based menu restrictions applied (breakfast items only before 11 AM, etc.)
- Seasonal or promotional items activated automatically based on configured schedules
- Quality-based restrictions prevent sale of items below minimum quality thresholds

**Validation Rules**:
- Menu changes propagated to all POS terminals within 2 minutes
- Time-based restrictions enforced consistently across all POS terminals
- Quality thresholds respected with automatic item removal when violated
- Menu item pricing synchronized with ERP pricing engine

**Exception Handling**: 
- Menu update failures require manual intervention and customer notification
- Time synchronization issues may require manual override capabilities
- Quality assessment failures trigger immediate menu item removal

## Transaction Processing Rules

### Rule 3: Fractional Item Pricing Integration

**Description**: Ensures accurate fractional item pricing in POS systems with dynamic adjustments based on quality, time, and promotional factors.

- Promotional pricing overrides standard pricing with appropriate approvals

**Validation Rules**:
- Price calculations accurate within $0.01 of ERP-calculated prices
- Discount applications verified against business rules before processing
- Price change notifications sent to POS terminals within 60 seconds
- Promotional pricing requires active promotion verification

**Exception Handling**: 
- Pricing calculation errors default to last-known valid price with management alert
- Discount validation failures require manual price verification
- Promotional pricing failures revert to standard pricing until resolved

### Rule 4: Order Modification and Customization

**Description**: Handles customer requests for fractional item modifications, special preparations, and customizations through POS integration.

**Trigger**: Customer customization requests, special order processing, or modification system events

**Business Logic**:
