This document defines business rules for managing purchase orders within the Carmen ERP system, ensuring proper procurement processes, budget compliance, approval workflows, and supplier management for hospitality operations.

**Business Context**: Purchase orders are critical procurement documents that formalize purchasing commitments, control spending, maintain supplier relationships, and ensure proper financial controls throughout the organization.

## Core Business Rules

### Rule 1: Purchase Order Creation Requirements

**Description**: Establishes mandatory requirements for creating valid purchase orders with proper authorization and documentation.

**Trigger**: Purchase order initiation, purchase request conversion, or direct order creation

**Business Logic**: 
- Purchase orders must originate from approved purchase requests or emergency procurement
- All line items require valid product codes and vendor catalog references
- Delivery locations must be active and approved for receiving
- Budget availability verified before order confirmation

**Validation Rules**:
- Minimum order value: $25 (below threshold requires manager approval)
- Maximum single line item quantity: 9,999 units
- Vendor must have active status and approved credit terms
- Delivery date must be at least 2 business days from order date (except rush orders)

**Exception Handling**: 
- Emergency orders bypass normal approval workflow but require post-approval within 24 hours
- Invalid product codes trigger automatic product catalog lookup and suggestion
- Budget overrides require finance manager approval with justification

### Rule 2: Vendor Selection and Validation

**Description**: Ensures purchase orders are placed with approved vendors meeting quality, financial, and compliance standards.

**Trigger**: Vendor selection, vendor status changes, or compliance assessment updates

**Business Logic**: 
- Only approved vendors eligible for purchase order placement

- Special handling requirements documented for specific vendors

**Validation Rules**:
- Vendor approval status verified within 24 hours of last update
- Performance rating minimum threshold: 3.0/5.0 for standard orders

- Insurance and licensing requirements current for regulated products

**Exception Handling**: 
- Vendor approval expiration triggers immediate review and renewal process

- Payment term mismatches require vendor agreement verification

### Rule 3: Budget Control and Spend Authorization

**Description**: Enforces budget controls and spending authorization limits across all purchase orders to maintain financial discipline.

**Trigger**: Order value calculation, budget period changes, or authorization level updates

**Business Logic**: 
- Purchase order values counted against department and project budgets

**Validation Rules**:
- Department budget variance cannot exceed +10% without CEO approval
- Individual order authority: Staff ($500), Supervisor ($2,000), Manager ($10,000), Director ($50,000)
- Capital expenditure orders require separate approval workflow regardless of value
- Emergency orders limited to $1,000 per incident without pre-approval

**Exception Handling**: 
- Budget unavailability blocks order creation until budget adjustment or reallocation

- Emergency spending requires documented emergency justification

## Approval Workflows

- Rejection requires documented reason and suggested alternatives

### Rule 5: Amendment and Change Control

**Description**: Manages changes to approved purchase orders with appropriate re-approval requirements and audit trails.

**Validation Rules**:
