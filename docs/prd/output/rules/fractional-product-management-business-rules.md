## Overview

This document defines business rules for managing fractional products in the Carmen ERP system, specifically focusing on pizza slices, cake portions, and other divisible food items. These rules ensure food safety compliance, quality standards, operational efficiency, and revenue optimization while supporting hospitality business objectives.

**Business Context**: Modern hospitality operations require flexible product offerings including individual portions of larger items. This capability enables businesses to serve customers with varying portion needs while maximizing revenue from prepared items and minimizing waste.

## Core Business Rules

### Rule 1: Product Fractional Capability Definition

**Description**: Determines which products can be sold in fractional portions and establishes the foundation for fractional inventory management.

**Trigger**: Product creation, product modification, or system configuration changes

**Business Logic**: 
- Only specific product categories support fractional sales (Pizza, Cake, Pie, Casserole, etc.)
- Products must have defined portion configurations before fractional sales can be activated
- Each fractional product must specify minimum and maximum portion sizes
- Products with fractional capability require additional tracking and quality controls

**Validation Rules**:
- Product category must be in approved fractional categories list
- Minimum portions per whole item: 2
- Maximum portions per whole item: 16
- Base unit of measure must be "Each" or "Whole"
- Shelf life must be defined for quality tracking

**Exception Handling**: 
- Products without proper categorization cannot enable fractional sales
- System blocks fractional activation if required fields are missing
- Manager override required for exceptions to standard portion limits

### Rule 2: Portion Size Standardization

**Description**: Establishes consistent portion sizes across the organization to ensure customer satisfaction and cost control.

**Trigger**: Product setup, portion configuration, or quality control reviews

**Business Logic**: 
- Standard portion sizes must be defined per product type
- Pizza slices: 8 slices per 14" pizza, 6 slices per 12" pizza, 4 slices per personal pizza
- Cake portions: Weight-based portioning with tolerance ranges (90-110g standard slice)
- Portion consistency must maintain 85-115% of standard size
- Visual presentation standards apply to all fractional portions

**Validation Rules**:
- Portion weight variance cannot exceed ±10g for cakes
- Pizza slice angle variance cannot exceed ±15 degrees
- All portions must meet minimum presentation score of 7/10
- Cutting tools must be appropriate for product type

**Exception Handling**: 
- Portions outside tolerance ranges require quality review
- Customer requests for non-standard portions require approval
- Presentation scores below threshold trigger automatic price adjustments

### Rule 3: Multi-Yield Recipe Integration

**Description**: Manages recipes that produce multiple fractional products simultaneously to optimize production efficiency.

**Trigger**: Recipe execution, production planning, or ingredient allocation

**Business Logic**: 
- Multi-yield recipes automatically calculate portion distributions
- Ingredient costs are allocated proportionally across all output portions
- Production timing must account for cutting and portioning time
- Quality standards apply to each individual portion produced

**Validation Rules**:
- Total portion count must equal expected yield
- Individual portion costs must equal allocated recipe costs
- Production time includes cutting/portioning in scheduling
- All output portions tracked in inventory immediately upon completion

**Exception Handling**: 
- Yield variations beyond 5% trigger production review
- Equipment failures during portioning require waste documentation
- Quality failures in portions affect entire batch evaluation

## Quality Control Rules

### Rule 4: Fractional Item Quality Standards

**Description**: Maintains consistent quality standards for all fractional products to ensure customer satisfaction and brand reputation.

**Trigger**: Product cutting, quality inspection, or customer feedback

**Business Logic**:

**Validation Rules**:
- Pizza slices must maintain 140°F minimum serving temperature
- Refrigerated cake portions must stay at 35-41°F storage temperature
- Visual quality scores must achieve minimum 7/10 rating
- Freshness indicators monitored continuously with defined thresholds

**Exception Handling**: 
- Items below quality thresholds receive automatic markdowns
- Temperature violations trigger immediate corrective actions
- Customer complaints initiate quality investigation protocols

### Rule 5: Shelf Life and Expiration Management

**Description**: Manages time-based quality degradation for fractional items to ensure food safety and optimize inventory turnover.

**Trigger**: Item preparation completion, cutting operations, or time-based system checks

**Business Logic**: 
- Fractional items inherit base item shelf life with cutting adjustments
- Hot-held pizza slices: Maximum 4 hours display time
- Refrigerated cake slices: Maximum 72 hours from cutting
- Quality degradation curves applied for pricing optimization

**Validation Rules**:
- No fractional sales beyond defined shelf life limits
- Display time tracking accurate to 15-minute intervals
- Automatic removal from sale when expiration approached
- Waste documentation required for expired items

**Exception Handling**: 
- Emergency extensions require food safety manager approval
- Equipment failures affecting monitoring trigger manual tracking
- Quality degradation faster than expected requires investigation

## Food Safety and Compliance Rules

- Staff certifications current and verified

**Exception Handling**: 
- Critical limit violations trigger immediate corrective actions
- Monitoring equipment failures activate backup protocols
- Non-compliance incidents require documented investigation

### Rule 7: Allergen Management for Fractional Items

**Description**: Manages allergen information and cross-contamination prevention in fractional food operations.

**Trigger**: Product cutting, tool usage, or allergen detection

**Business Logic**: 
- Allergen information transfers from whole items to fractional portions
- Cutting tools and surfaces managed by allergen categories
- Cross-contamination risks assessed before fractional operations
- Allergen labeling required on all fractional item displays

**Validation Rules**:
- Tool sanitization verified between allergen categories
