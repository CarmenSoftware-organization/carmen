- Schedule changes communicated 48 hours in advance with user notification

**Exception Handling**: 
- After-hours access violations trigger security alerts and investigation
- Emergency access available with incident documentation and follow-up review
- Schedule conflicts resolved through role modification or exception approval

### Rule 6: Data Classification and Protection

**Description**: Implements data classification scheme with appropriate protection controls based on sensitivity and regulatory requirements.

**Business Logic**: 
- Data classified as Public, Internal, Confidential, or Restricted
- Protection controls escalate based on classification level
- Personal data subject to privacy regulations receives enhanced protection
- Financial data access restricted to qualified personnel with business need

**Validation Rules**:
- Data classification applied consistently across all system components
- Protection controls verified through automated security scanning
- Privacy regulation compliance validated through quarterly assessments
- Financial data access reviewed monthly with exception reporting

**Exception Handling**: 
- Classification errors require immediate correction and impact assessment
- Protection control failures trigger security incident response procedures
- Privacy violations may require regulatory notification and remediation

## User Lifecycle Management

### Rule 7: User Provisioning and Deprovisioning

**Description**: Manages user account lifecycle from creation through termination with appropriate security and audit controls.

**Business Logic**: 
- New user accounts provisioned based on job role with manager approval

- Role changes processed within 24 hours with appropriate access adjustments
- Account termination processed immediately upon employment end with complete access removal

**Validation Rules**:
- Account provisioning requires HR verification and manager authorization
- Security training completion verified before system access granted
- Role change requests include business justification and approval documentation
- Termination processing includes comprehensive access review and asset recovery

**Exception Handling**: 
- Provisioning errors require immediate correction and access verification
- Training completion delays may require temporary restricted access
- Termination processing failures trigger manual verification and correction

### Rule 8: Password and Authentication Management

**Description**: Establishes password requirements and multi-factor authentication controls for secure system access.
