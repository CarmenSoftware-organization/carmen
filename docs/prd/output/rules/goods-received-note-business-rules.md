## Overview

This document defines business rules for managing goods received notes within the Carmen ERP system, ensuring accurate receipt documentation, inventory updates, quality control, and financial integration for hospitality operations.

**Business Context**: Goods Received Notes are critical documents that confirm receipt of goods, trigger inventory updates, enable payment processing, and provide audit trails for procurement activities while ensuring quality standards are maintained.

## Core Business Rules

### Rule 1: GRN Creation Requirements

**Description**: Establishes mandatory requirements for creating valid goods received notes with proper documentation and verification.

**Trigger**: Goods receipt, delivery confirmation, or manual GRN creation

**Business Logic**:

- Date and time stamps automated for audit trail accuracy

**Validation Rules**:
- Purchase order reference required for all non-emergency receipts
- Delivery date cannot be future-dated beyond current system date
- Receiving staff must have active user status and receiving authorization
- GRN numbers follow sequential numbering with no gaps allowed

**Exception Handling**:

- Missing purchase order references trigger emergency receipt workflow
- System dating errors require supervisor override and manual correction

### Rule 2: Quantity Verification and Variance Management

**Description**: Manages quantity verification processes and handles variances between ordered and received quantities.

**Trigger**: Quantity entry, variance detection, or receipt completion

**Business Logic**: 
- Received quantities verified against purchase order specifications
- Quantity variances documented with reason codes and supporting evidence
- Over-receipts require authorization if exceeding order quantity by >5%
- Under-receipts automatically flag for follow-up and supplier communication

**Validation Rules**:
- Quantity variances >10% require supervisor approval
- Over-receipts cannot exceed 110% of ordered quantity without director approval
- Partial receipts must specify delivery completion status and expected balance
- Rejected quantities documented with quality inspection reports

**Exception Handling**: 
- Significant over-receipts may require return authorization or storage arrangements
- Partial deliveries trigger automatic follow-up scheduling
- Quality-based rejections initiate vendor quality notification processes

### Rule 3: Quality Inspection and Acceptance

**Description**: Ensures received goods meet quality specifications through systematic inspection and acceptance procedures.

**Trigger**: Goods receipt, quality inspection scheduling, or acceptance decision points

**Business Logic**: 
- Quality inspection required based on product risk classification and vendor history
- Inspection criteria based on product specifications and regulatory requirements
- Acceptance/rejection decisions documented with supporting evidence
- Failed inspections trigger supplier corrective action and potential credit claims

**Validation Rules**:
- High-risk products require 100% inspection before acceptance
