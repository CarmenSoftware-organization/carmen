## Overview

This document defines business rules for managing fractional inventory within the Carmen ERP system, including dual-state tracking, conversion operations, stock movements, and inventory optimization for products sold in both whole and fractional forms.

**Business Context**: Fractional inventory management requires sophisticated tracking of items in multiple states (whole, prepared, portioned, partial) while maintaining accuracy across conversions, ensuring food safety, and optimizing inventory turnover.

## Core Business Rules

### Rule 1: Dual-State Inventory Tracking

**Description**: Maintains accurate inventory records for items existing in both whole and fractional states simultaneously with real-time synchronization.

**Trigger**: Stock receipt, conversion operations, sales transactions, or inventory adjustments

**Business Logic**: 
- System tracks whole units and fractional portions separately but interdependently
- Conversion operations automatically update both whole and fractional inventories
- Total inventory value equals sum of whole units plus fractional portions
- Physical inventory requires counting both states for accurate reconciliation

**Validation Rules**:
- Total fractional portions cannot exceed whole unit capacity based on defined portion ratios
- Conversion operations must maintain mathematical accuracy within ±1% tolerance
- Inventory adjustments require documentation and approval for both states
- System prevents negative inventory in either whole or fractional states

**Exception Handling**: 
- Inventory discrepancies between states trigger immediate investigation
- Conversion calculation errors require manual verification and correction
- System synchronization failures activate backup tracking protocols

### Rule 2: Stock State Management

**Description**: Manages inventory items through defined states (RAW, PREPARED, PORTIONED, PARTIAL, COMBINED, WASTE) with controlled transitions and business rule enforcement.

**Trigger**: State transition requests, quality assessments, or time-based state changes

**Business Logic**: 
- State transitions follow defined workflows with approval requirements
- Time limits apply to certain states to maintain food safety and quality
- Quality grades affect allowable state transitions and available operations
- Waste state captures all loss factors for accurate costing and analysis

**Validation Rules**:
- State transitions must follow approved pathways (RAW→PREPARED→PORTIONED, etc.)
- Time limits enforced: PREPARED items must be portioned within 4 hours
- Quality requirements: Only EXCELLENT and GOOD grades qualify for customer sales
- Waste classification requires documented justification and approval

**Exception Handling**: 
- Unauthorized state transitions blocked with management override capability
- Time limit violations trigger automatic quality degradation or waste classification
- Quality failures during transitions require re-evaluation or disposal protocols

### Rule 3: Conversion Operation Rules

- Allocation algorithms optimize between reserved and available inventory
- Reservation cancellations return inventory to available status immediately

**Validation Rules**:
- Reserved quantities cannot exceed available inventory plus safety margins
- Reservation duration limited to maximum 48 hours for perishable items
- Allocation changes require inventory rebalancing within 15 minutes
- Cancellation processing completed within 30 minutes of request

**Exception Handling**: 
- Over-reservation situations require immediate inventory reallocation
- Expired reservations automatically return to available inventory
- Allocation conflicts resolved through priority-based assignment algorithms

## Quality and Freshness Management

### Rule 6: Time-Based Quality Degradation
