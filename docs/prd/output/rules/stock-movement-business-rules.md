- Emergency movements allowed with post-approval within 4 hours

**Validation Rules**:
- Movement requests include source/destination locations and justification
- Authorization levels: Staff ($100), Supervisor ($500), Manager ($2,500), Director (unlimited)
- High-value items (>$1,000) require dual approval regardless of authorization level
- Emergency movements limited to $500 per incident without pre-approval

**Exception Handling**: 
- Unauthorized movements blocked until proper approval obtained
- Emergency movement abuse triggers automatic review and potential disciplinary action
- System failures activate manual approval processes with subsequent system reconciliation

### Rule 2: Location and Storage Validation

- Receiving confirmation required within 50% of transit time limit
- Cost center coding verified against organizational structure

**Exception Handling**: 
- Missing transfer documentation blocks movement until completion
- Transit time violations trigger immediate investigation and location verification
- Receiving confirmation delays prompt automated follow-up and escalation

### Rule 5: Consumption Movement Rules

**Description**: Tracks consumption movements from inventory to production, sales, or operational use.

**Trigger**: Production requirements, sales transactions, or operational consumption

**Business Logic**: 
- Consumption automatically recorded through POS and production systems
- Recipe-based consumption calculated accurately for standardized production
- Operational consumption requires proper justification and approval
- Consumption patterns analyzed for trend identification and optimization

**Validation Rules**:
- Recipe consumption within ±10% of standard quantities
- Operational consumption requires department manager approval for unusual amounts
- Consumption timing aligned with production schedules and sales patterns
- Waste percentages tracked and maintained below established thresholds

**Exception Handling**: 
- Recipe variance exceeding limits triggers production review and adjustment
- Unusual consumption patterns prompt investigation and corrective action
- System integration failures require manual consumption entry with audit trail

### Rule 6: Waste and Loss Movement Rules

**Description**: Manages waste, spoilage, damage, and other loss movements with proper documentation and analysis.

**Trigger**: Waste identification, damage reports, spoilage detection, or loss documentation

**Business Logic**: 
- Waste movements categorized by type (spoilage, damage, operational, etc.)
- Loss documentation includes reason codes and photographic evidence when appropriate
- Waste disposal follows environmental regulations and company sustainability policies
- Loss analysis conducted regularly to identify improvement opportunities

**Validation Rules**:
- Waste movements >$100 require supervisor approval and documentation
- Photographic evidence required for damage claims or unusual loss amounts
- Environmental compliance verified for all waste disposal methods
- Loss percentages monitored: Food waste <3%, Damage <1%, Other <0.5%

**Exception Handling**: 
- Excessive waste triggers immediate investigation and process improvement
