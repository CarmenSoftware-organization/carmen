## Overview

This document defines business rules for budget control within the Carmen ERP system, ensuring fiscal responsibility, spend authorization, variance management, and financial accountability across hospitality operations.

## Core Business Rules

### Rule 1: Budget Authorization and Limits

**Description**: Establishes spending authorization limits and approval requirements based on budget allocations and organizational hierarchy.

**Business Logic**: 
- Department managers authorized up to 100% of monthly budget allocation

- Budget variance calculations updated in real-time with transaction processing
- Emergency spending requires post-approval within 24 hours with documentation
- Capital expenditures follow separate approval workflow regardless of amount

**Exception Handling**: 
- Budget overruns blocked unless emergency authorization obtained
- Authorization limit breaches trigger automatic escalation to next approval level
- Emergency spending abuse results in temporary authorization suspension

### Rule 2: Multi-Dimensional Budget Control

**Description**: Manages budget control across multiple dimensions including department, project, location, and cost category.

**Business Logic**: 
- Budget allocations maintained by department, location, and expense category
- Project-specific budgets tracked separately with dedicated approval workflows
- Cross-dimensional reporting provides comprehensive budget visibility
- Budget transfers between categories require appropriate authorization

**Validation Rules**:
- All purchases must be allocated to valid budget dimensions
- Project budgets cannot exceed approved total without change order approval

- Unallocated expenses flagged for immediate attention and correction

**Exception Handling**: 
- Invalid budget codes block transaction processing until correction
- Project budget overruns trigger immediate project manager notification

**Exception Handling**: 
- Unusual seasonal patterns may require budget reallocation

- Contract changes trigger automatic encumbrance adjustment

### Rule 6: Variance Analysis and Reporting

**Description**: Analyzes budget variances and provides comprehensive reporting for management decision-making.

- Favorable and unfavorable variances categorized by controllable factors
- Management reporting includes variance explanations and corrective actions

**Validation Rules**:
