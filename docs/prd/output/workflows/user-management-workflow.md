## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: User Registration and Identity Verification
- **Actor**: HR / IT Administrator / New Employee
- **Action**: Submit user registration request with personal information, job role, and access requirements
- **System Response**: Creates provisional user record, initiates identity verification, generates temporary credentials
- **Decision Points**: Is identity properly verified? What access level is appropriate? Any special requirements?
- **Next Step**: Step 2 (Role Assignment)

### Step 2: Role Assignment and Permission Configuration
- **Actor**: IT Administrator / Security Officer / Department Manager
- **Action**: Assign user roles based on job function, configure permissions, set access restrictions
- **System Response**: Applies role-based permissions, configures system access, validates security settings
- **Decision Points**: Are roles appropriate for job function? Should any restrictions be applied? Approval needed?
- **Next Step**: Step 3 (Account Setup)

### Step 3: Account Setup and System Configuration
- **Actor**: IT Administrator / System
- **Action**: Complete user account configuration, set password policies, configure multi-factor authentication
- **System Response**: Activates user account, sends welcome credentials, logs account creation
- **Decision Points**: Are security settings adequate? Should additional authentication be required?
- **Next Step**: Step 4 (Access Validation)

### Step 4: Access Validation and Testing
- **Actor**: User / IT Support
- **Action**: Test account access, verify permissions, validate system functionality
- **System Response**: Logs access attempts, validates permissions, records system usage
- **Decision Points**: Is access working properly? Are permissions correct? Any issues to resolve?
- **Next Step**: Step 5 (Training and Orientation)

### Step 5: Security Training and Compliance
- **Actor**: User / Security Team / Training Coordinator
- **Action**: Complete mandatory security training, acknowledge policies, verify compliance understanding
- **System Response**: Records training completion, tracks policy acknowledgments, updates compliance status
- **Decision Points**: Is training complete? Are policies understood? Additional training needed?
- **Next Step**: Step 6 (Ongoing Monitoring)

### Step 6: Access Monitoring and Compliance Tracking
- **Actor**: Security Monitoring System / IT Security
- **Action**: Monitor user access patterns, detect anomalies, track compliance requirements
- **System Response**: Generates access reports, identifies security issues, tracks compliance metrics
- **Decision Points**: Any suspicious activity? Compliance issues? Access changes needed?
- **Next Step**: Step 7 (Periodic Review)

### Step 7: Periodic Access Review and Update
- **Actor**: Department Manager / IT Administrator / User
- **Action**: Review access requirements, update roles as needed, modify permissions based on job changes
- **System Response**: Processes access changes, updates permissions, maintains audit trail
- **Decision Points**: Are current permissions appropriate? Should access be expanded or restricted?
- **Next Step**: Continue monitoring or process access changes

### Step 8: Account Deactivation (When Applicable)
- **Actor**: HR / IT Administrator
- **Action**: Process user departure, deactivate accounts, archive user data, transfer ownership
- **System Response**: Disables access, archives records, transfers data ownership, maintains audit records
- **Decision Points**: Is all data properly transferred? Should account be archived or deleted?
- **Next Step**: Complete deactivation process
