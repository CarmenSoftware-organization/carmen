## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Customer Order Initiation
- **Actor**: Customer / POS Staff
- **Action**: 
  - Customer selects fractional item (pizza slice, cake slice) from POS menu
  - Staff member inputs order details including portion size and special requirements
  - System validates availability and calculates pricing
- **System Response**: 
  - Checks current portion inventory levels
  - Calculates availability from both existing portions and whole units
  - Displays real-time availability and estimated preparation time
  - Updates order cart with fractional item details
- **Decision Points**: 
  - Is the requested portion available from existing inventory?
  - Should whole units be converted to meet demand?
  - Are there quality concerns with existing portions?
- **Next Step**: If portions available → Step 6 (Order Fulfillment), If conversion needed → Step 2

### Step 2: Inventory Assessment and Conversion Planning
- **Actor**: Kitchen Manager / System (Automated)
- **Action**:
  - System analyzes current fractional inventory state
  - Calculates optimal conversion strategy from whole units
  - Reviews quality scores and shelf life of existing portions
  - Generates conversion recommendations with efficiency metrics
- **System Response**:
  - Displays conversion recommendations with waste projections
  - Shows quality impact analysis for different conversion options
  - Calculates total preparation time including conversion
  - Updates inventory projections based on conversion plan
- **Decision Points**:
  - Which conversion strategy minimizes waste while meeting demand?
  - Are existing portions of acceptable quality for sale?
  - Should conversion happen immediately or be scheduled?
- **Next Step**: If immediate conversion needed → Step 3, If scheduling required → Step 4

### Step 3: Immediate Conversion Execution
- **Actor**: Kitchen Staff
- **Action**:

- **System Response**:
  - Updates inventory records to reflect conversion in progress
  - Tracks conversion start time and estimated completion
  - Monitors compliance with food safety and quality standards
  - Generates conversion record with staff attribution
- **Decision Points**:
  - Does the conversion meet quality standards?
  - Are portions uniform and within acceptable variance?
  - Should any portions be marked for discount due to quality?
- **Next Step**: Step 5 (Post-Conversion Quality Check)

### Step 4: Scheduled Conversion Planning
- **Actor**: Kitchen Manager / Automated System
- **Action**:
  - System schedules conversion based on demand forecasting

  - Sends notifications to kitchen staff for planned conversions
- **System Response**:
  - Creates conversion schedule with priority levels
  - Sets automated alerts for conversion timing
  - Updates demand projections based on historical patterns
  - Reserves inventory for scheduled conversions
- **Decision Points**:
  - When is the optimal time to perform conversion?
  - How many units should be converted in anticipation of demand?
  - Should conversion be spread across multiple time periods?
- **Next Step**: At scheduled time → Step 3 (Conversion Execution)

### Step 5: Post-Conversion Quality Check and Storage
- **Actor**: Kitchen Staff / Quality Control Officer
- **Action**:
  - Inspect all converted portions for quality compliance
  - Measure portion sizes for consistency (weight/size variance)
  - Assess visual presentation and overall quality
  - Apply appropriate storage and display procedures
- **System Response**:
  - Records quality scores for each batch of portions
  - Updates inventory with newly available portions
  - Sets quality degradation timers based on item type
  - Generates quality compliance documentation
- **Decision Points**:
  - Do all portions meet minimum quality standards?
  - Should any portions receive quality-based price adjustments?
  - Are storage conditions optimal for maintaining quality?
- **Next Step**: Step 6 (Order Fulfillment)

### Step 6: Order Fulfillment and Customer Service
- **Actor**: Service Staff
- **Action**:
  - Retrieve requested portions from storage/display
  - Verify portion quality meets customer service standards
  - Apply any garnishes, heating, or final preparation steps
  - Package for dine-in or takeaway as requested
- **System Response**:
  - Updates portion inventory in real-time
  - Records sale transaction with portion tracking
  - Calculates updated availability for future orders
  - Updates quality metrics based on portion selection
- **Decision Points**:
  - Is the selected portion of acceptable quality for customer service?
  - Should customer be offered alternative portions or discounts?
  - Are special preparation requests feasible?
- **Next Step**: Step 7 (Transaction Completion)

### Step 7: Transaction Completion and Inventory Update
- **Actor**: POS System / Service Staff
- **Action**:
  - Process payment for fractional item order
  - Generate receipt with detailed portion information
  - Update all inventory systems with final transaction details
  - Collect customer feedback if requested
- **System Response**:
  - Deducts sold portions from available inventory
  - Updates demand analytics with sales data
  - Records transaction in audit trail with complete details
  - Triggers inventory alerts if levels fall below thresholds
- **Decision Points**:
  - Should customer be asked for feedback on portion quality?
  - Are inventory levels sufficient for upcoming demand?
  - Should conversion planning be updated based on sales velocity?
- **Next Step**: Workflow complete, monitor inventory levels
