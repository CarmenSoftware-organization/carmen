## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Count Planning and Scheduling
- **Actor**: Inventory Manager / Planning System
- **Action**: Define count scope (cycle, full, spot), schedule timing, assign counting teams
- **System Response**: Creates count instructions, generates count sheets, assigns locations and items
- **Decision Points**: What count methodology? Which locations/items? When to minimize disruption?
- **Next Step**: Step 2 (Team Preparation)

### Step 2: Count Team Preparation and Training
- **Actor**: Count Supervisors / Counting Teams
- **Action**: Brief teams on procedures, distribute count sheets, verify equipment readiness
- **System Response**: Records team assignments, provides count instructions, tracks preparation status
- **Decision Points**: Are teams properly trained? Is equipment functioning? Are procedures clear?
- **Next Step**: Step 3 (Physical Counting)

### Step 3: Physical Counting Execution
- **Actor**: Counting Teams / Count Supervisors
- **Action**: Perform physical counts, record quantities, note discrepancies and issues
- **System Response**: Captures count data, identifies significant variances, validates completeness
- **Decision Points**: Are counts complete and accurate? Should recounts be performed? Any issues requiring attention?
- **Next Step**: Step 4 (Count Verification)

### Step 4: Count Verification and Recount Processing
- **Actor**: Count Supervisors / Independent Verification Team
- **Action**: Verify count accuracy, perform recounts for significant variances, validate results
- **System Response**: Compares counts to system records, calculates variances, flags items for review
- **Decision Points**: Are variances within acceptable limits? Should additional recounts be performed?
- **Next Step**: Step 5 (Variance Analysis)

### Step 5: Variance Analysis and Investigation
- **Actor**: Inventory Analysts / Management
- **Action**: Investigate significant variances, determine root causes, recommend corrective actions
- **System Response**: Generates variance reports, analyzes trends, calculates financial impact
- **Decision Points**: What are root causes? What corrections are needed? Should processes be improved?
- **Next Step**: Step 6 (Adjustment Processing)

### Step 6: Inventory Adjustment and System Update
- **Actor**: Inventory Management System
- **Action**: Process approved adjustments, update inventory records, calculate financial impact
- **System Response**: Updates all systems, generates adjustment records, maintains audit trails
- **Decision Points**: Are all adjustments accurate? Is financial impact properly recorded?
- **Next Step**: Step 7 (Performance Analysis)

### Step 7: Performance Analysis and Reporting
- **Actor**: Management / Analytics System
- **Action**: Analyze count performance, identify improvement opportunities, generate reports
- **System Response**: Creates performance dashboards, tracks accuracy trends, provides insights
- **Decision Points**: What improvements are needed? Should procedures be updated?
- **Next Step**: Workflow complete, implement improvements

## Error Handling

### Counting Errors: Systematic recount procedures with independent verification
### System Failures: Manual backup processes with full reconciliation  
### Large Variances: Mandatory investigation and management approval
### Equipment Issues: Backup equipment and alternative counting methods

## Business Rules Integration

- **Count Frequency**: Risk-based counting schedules with high-value item prioritization
- **Variance Thresholds**: Defined acceptable variance limits with escalation procedures
- **Approval Requirements**: Management approval for adjustments above defined thresholds
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete documentation and audit trail maintenance

This workflow ensures inventory accuracy through systematic counting processes while maintaining operational efficiency and regulatory compliance.
