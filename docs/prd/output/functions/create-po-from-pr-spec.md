## Business Scenarios

**Scenario: Single Vendor Purchase Order Creation**: 
User selects multiple purchase requests from the same vendor with identical currency. System groups all requests into a single purchase order preview. User confirms selection and navigates to standard purchase order creation workflow with consolidated items and totals.

**Scenario: Multi-Vendor Bulk Processing**: 
User selects purchase requests from different vendors or with different currencies. System creates multiple groupings, each representing a separate purchase order. User confirms selection and navigates to bulk creation workflow for processing multiple purchase orders simultaneously.

**Scenario: Department-Specific Conversion**: 
Department manager searches for purchase requests from their specific department using location and requestor filters. Manager selects relevant requests and initiates conversion, ensuring department budget tracking and approval workflow compliance.

**Exception Scenario: No Eligible Purchase Requests**: 
User accesses conversion interface when no approved purchase requests exist. System displays appropriate message explaining approval requirements and provides navigation back to purchase request management for status review.

**Exception Scenario: Search Yields No Results**: 
User applies search criteria that match no existing purchase requests. System provides clear feedback about search results and suggests alternative search terms or criteria modification.
