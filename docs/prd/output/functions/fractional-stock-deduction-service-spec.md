# Fractional Stock Deduction Service Functional Specification

## Overview
The Fractional Stock Deduction Service is a specialized inventory management component designed to handle complex stock calculations when fractional products are sold through Point of Sale (POS) systems. This service supports scenarios such as selling pizza slices from whole pizzas, cake portions from whole cakes, and other fractional product sales while maintaining accurate inventory levels and cost tracking.

## Component Architecture

### Primary Components
- **FractionalStockDeductionService**: Main service class handling transaction processing
- **Transaction Processing Engine**: Manages individual POS transaction calculations
- **Batch Processing System**: Handles multiple transactions in sequence
- **Simulation Engine**: Provides feasibility checking without committing changes
- **Variance Analysis Module**: Calculates theoretical vs actual consumption differences

### Design Patterns
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Encapsulates business logic in dedicated service class
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different calculation strategies for various fractional sales types
- **Factory Pattern**: Creates appropriate calculation instances based on product type
- **Transaction Pattern**: Ensures atomic operations for batch processing

## Core Functionality

### Function 1: Process Transaction
- **Purpose**: Processes a single POS transaction and calculates all required stock deductions
- **Inputs**: 
  - `POSTransaction`: Transaction details (ID, item code, quantity, price, location)
  - `RecipeMapping`: Maps POS items to recipe variants
  - `Recipe`: Base recipe with yield variants
  - `Map<string, number>`: Current inventory levels by item ID
- **Processing**: 
  1. Validates recipe variant exists
  2. Calculates base recipe quantity needed using conversion rate
  3. Applies variant-specific wastage rates
  4. Processes each ingredient deduction with wastage calculations
  5. Updates inventory levels
  6. Tracks costs and inventory impacts
- **Outputs**: 
  - `StockDeductionResult`: Complete transaction processing results including success status, errors, deductions, costs, and inventory impacts

### Function 2: Process Batch Transactions
- **Purpose**: Handles multiple POS transactions in chronological order with cumulative inventory tracking
- **Inputs**:
  - `POSTransaction[]`: Array of transactions to process
  - `Map<string, RecipeMapping>`: POS item to recipe mappings
  - `Map<string, Recipe>`: Recipe definitions
  - `Map<string, number>`: Initial inventory levels
- **Processing**:
  1. Sorts transactions by timestamp
  2. Processes each transaction sequentially
  3. Updates working inventory after each transaction
  4. Accumulates totals and statistics
- **Outputs**:
  - Array of individual transaction results
  - Final inventory state
  - Batch summary with totals and statistics

### Function 3: Simulate Deduction
- **Purpose**: Performs feasibility analysis without committing inventory changes
- **Inputs**: Same as Process Transaction but inventory is cloned
- **Processing**:
  1. Clones current inventory to avoid mutations
  2. Runs full transaction processing on cloned data
  3. Analyzes results for feasibility
- **Outputs**:
  - Feasibility boolean
  - List of potential issues
  - Estimated costs
  - Required ingredient details with shortfall analysis

### Function 4: Calculate Variance Report
- **Purpose**: Analyzes theoretical vs actual consumption patterns over a period
- **Inputs**:
  - `StockDeductionResult[]`: Historical transaction results
  - Date range for analysis period
- **Processing**:
  1. Aggregates consumption data by ingredient
  2. Calculates theoretical usage based on recipes
  3. Compares with actual deductions including wastage
  4. Computes variance percentages
- **Outputs**:
  - Period summary with total theoretical vs actual consumption
  - Per-ingredient variance analysis
  - Overall wastage percentage

## Error Handling

### Exception Scenarios

#### Recipe Not Found
- **Trigger**: POS item has no corresponding recipe mapping
- **Response**: Return failure result with descriptive error
- **Recovery**: Log unmapped item for manual review

#### Insufficient Inventory
- **Trigger**: Required ingredients below available stock
- **Response**: Calculate partial deduction and log shortfall
- **Recovery**: Continue processing but flag for inventory replenishment

#### Variant Mismatch
- **Trigger**: Recipe variant referenced in mapping doesn't exist
- **Response**: Fail transaction with validation error
- **Recovery**: Use default variant if available, otherwise reject

#### Calculation Overflow
- **Trigger**: Extremely large quantities causing numeric overflow
- **Response**: Fail transaction with overflow error
- **Recovery**: Apply quantity limits and retry if within bounds

### Error Recovery Strategies

#### Graceful Degradation
- Continue batch processing even if individual transactions fail
- Return partial results with clear indication of failures
- Maintain data consistency by not partially updating inventory

#### Retry Logic
- Implement exponential backoff for transient failures
- Retry inventory updates up to 3 times with increasing delays
- Log persistent failures for manual intervention

#### Data Validation
- Validate all input data before processing
- Check conversion rates and wastage percentages for reasonable ranges
- Verify recipe ingredient quantities are positive values

## Security Considerations
