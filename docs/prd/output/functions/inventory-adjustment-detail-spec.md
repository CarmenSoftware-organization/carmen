## Business Process Workflows

**Standard Operations**:
1. **Adjustment Creation**: User initiates new adjustment, selects location and reason, enters business justification, and adds affected inventory items with variance quantities
2. **Item Management**: Add inventory items through product lookup, specify adjustment quantities (positive for increases, negative for decreases), validate against current stock levels, and document business justification
3. **Review and Validation**: Verify all quantities and amounts are accurate, ensure proper reason codes are selected, validate financial impact is acceptable, and confirm supporting documentation is attached
4. **Posting Process**: Final review of journal entries and financial impact, execute posting to update inventory balances and create general ledger entries, distribute reports to relevant stakeholders

**Approval Processes**:
- Draft adjustments require supervisor review before posting authorization
- Large dollar value adjustments trigger additional management approval requirements
- Cross-location adjustments require both sending and receiving location approval
- System enforces approval limits based on user role and adjustment value
- Posted adjustments create immutable audit records with full traceability

**Error Handling**:
- Validation prevents posting of adjustments that would create negative inventory
- System alerts users to unusually large variances requiring additional justification
- Period-end restrictions prevent adjustments to closed accounting periods
- Concurrent editing protection prevents conflicting updates by multiple users
- Failed posting operations provide clear error messages and recovery guidance

**Business Rules**:
- Adjustment posting automatically updates inventory balances across all locations
- Journal entries are created automatically based on inventory valuation methods
- Posted adjustments cannot be modified, requiring reversal entries for corrections

4. Document business justification explaining likely causes (miscounts, damaged goods, theft)
5. Attach physical count sheets and variance analysis reports for audit trail
6. Submit adjustment for supervisor review and approval
7. Supervisor reviews variances, validates business justification, and approves posting
8. System updates inventory balances and creates journal entries reflecting financial impact
9. Generate variance reports for management review and process improvement analysis

*Expected Outcomes*: Accurate inventory balances reflecting physical reality, proper financial impact recognition, complete audit documentation for compliance requirements.

**Scenario 2: Damaged Inventory Write-off**

*Context*: Warehouse staff discovers damaged products that cannot be sold and must be removed from sellable inventory.

*Workflow Steps*:

*Workflow Steps*:
1. Quality control team identifies expired products during routine inspections
2. Create inventory adjustment selecting "Expiration/Obsolescence" reason code
3. Add expired items by lot number with negative quantities for complete removal
4. Document expiration dates and disposal requirements for regulatory compliance
5. Calculate potential recovery value through returns, donations, or alternative sales channels
6. Submit for quality manager approval with disposal recommendations
