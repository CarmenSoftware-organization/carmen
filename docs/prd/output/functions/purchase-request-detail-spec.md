## Business Process Workflows

**Standard Operations**:

*Purchase Request Creation*:
1. User initiates new purchase request from add mode
2. System provides empty request template with user context
3. User completes header information (approval workflow type, description, department)
4. User adds items with specifications and quantities
5. System validates required information completeness
6. User saves draft for future completion or submits for approval

*Purchase Request Review*:
1. User navigates to existing request from list or direct link
2. System displays current status and available actions based on user role
3. User reviews header information and item details
4. User can add comments, attachments, or request clarifications
5. System maintains complete interaction history

*Item Management*:
1. User accesses items tab to view request components
2. System displays items with role-appropriate information visibility
3. User can edit quantities, specifications, or delivery requirements
4. System provides inventory information and vendor comparison tools
5. User can perform bulk operations on selected items

**Approval Processes**:

*Workflow Progression*:
1. System routes requests through defined approval stages
2. Each stage requires appropriate user role for action permission
3. Workflow Decision Engine analyzes item statuses to determine available actions
4. Users can approve, reject, or return requests with required comments
5. System automatically advances to next stage or completes workflow
6. All workflow actions are logged with timestamps and justifications

*Item-Level Approval*:
1. Approvers review individual items within purchase requests
2. System enables item-level approve, reject, or review marking
3. Bulk operations allow efficient processing of multiple items
4. Comments can be added to explain approval decisions
5. Mixed status handling provides options for partial approvals

*Return and Revision Process*:
1. Approvers can return requests to previous stages with explanations
2. System provides step selector for targeted return destinations
3. Required comments explain reasons for return
4. Requestors receive returned items for revision or clarification
5. Revised requests re-enter approval workflow at appropriate stage

**Error Handling**:
- Form validation prevents submission of incomplete required information
- Permission checks block unauthorized actions with clear messaging
