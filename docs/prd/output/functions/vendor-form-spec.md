## Data Management Functions

**Information Display**:
Vendor information is organized into logical sections with Basic Information displaying company name, business type, operational status, and preferred currency. Contact sections show email, phone, and complete address details. Business information presents company registration numbers, tax identifiers, payment terms, certifications, and supported languages. Advanced sections contain additional notes and comprehensive validation results.

**Data Entry**:
Users input vendor information through structured form fields with appropriate input types for different data categories. Text fields capture names and addresses, email fields validate format automatically, phone fields accept international formats, dropdown menus provide standardized selections for business types and currencies, and text areas accommodate detailed payment terms and notes.

**Search & Filtering**:
Within certification and language selection, users can search through available options and filter to items not already selected. The system provides organized lists of standard business types, currencies, certifications, and languages while preventing duplicate selections.

**Data Relationships**:
Vendor information connects to user management for creation tracking, validation services for quality assessment, and broader procurement systems for sourcing activities. Currency preferences link to financial systems, business types connect to categorization systems, and contact information integrates with communication platforms.

## Business Process Workflows

**Standard Operations**:
Creating a new vendor begins with users accessing the vendor form, completing required basic information including company name and currency preference, providing contact details including email and complete address, configuring business information such as registration numbers and payment terms, and reviewing validation results before final submission. The system guides users through validation requirements and provides quality scoring throughout the process.

**Approval Processes**:
Vendor creation follows standard submission workflows where users complete all required information, system validates data quality and business rule compliance, form submission triggers vendor profile creation in the database, and successful creation provides immediate confirmation to users. Auto-save functionality periodically saves changes for existing vendor updates without requiring formal approval.

**Error Handling**:
When validation errors occur, the system displays specific error messages highlighting problematic fields with clear descriptions of requirements. Users can correct issues in real-time with immediate feedback. Network failures during submission are handled gracefully with retry mechanisms and data preservation. Form abandonment scenarios are addressed through auto-save capabilities preventing data loss.

**Business Rules**:
- Company names must be unique within the system and meet minimum length requirements
- Email addresses must be valid format and unique across vendor profiles  
- Phone numbers must follow international format standards with minimum digit requirements
- Complete addresses are required including street, city, state, postal code, and country
- Preferred currency selection is mandatory for financial integration purposes
- Status values are restricted to predefined options (active, inactive)
- Business registration and tax identification numbers follow format validation when provided
