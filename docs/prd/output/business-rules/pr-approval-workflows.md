# Purchase Request Approval Workflows Business Rules Specification

**Module**: Purchase Request Management  
**Business Domain**: Procurement and Financial Controls  
**Scope**: Purchase Request Approval Workflow Templates and Processing  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: August 14, 2025  
**Status**: Based on Source Code Analysis & System Behavior  

## Business Rules Overview

**Purpose**: These business rules govern the approval workflow processing for purchase requests in a hospitality ERP system, ensuring proper financial controls, budget compliance, and procurement authorization through structured approval templates.

**Scope**: Covers all purchase request approval processes from submission through final authorization, including workflow type selection, routing logic, approval authority validation, and status management across different procurement scenarios.

**Authority**: Business stakeholders include Finance Managers, Department Heads, General Managers, Purchasing Staff, and Procurement Coordinators who own and enforce these approval requirements.

**Implementation Status**: All core workflow rules are fully enforced through system validation. Advanced routing rules for emergency procurement and complex multi-department scenarios are partially implemented.

**Dependencies**: These rules depend on User Role Management for approval authority, Budget Management for financial limits, and Vendor Management for procurement validations.

## Data Integrity Rules

### Required Information

**Purchase Request Creation Requirements**
- All purchase requests must include requestor identification, department assignment, and location specification before workflow processing can begin
- Purchase request type must be selected from predefined workflow templates (General Purchase, Market List, Asset Purchase, Service Request) to determine appropriate approval routing
- Delivery date and description are mandatory for all requests to ensure proper planning and tracking
- Department and job code assignments are required for budget allocation and responsibility tracking

**Workflow Assignment Validation**
- System must validate that selected PR type corresponds to an active workflow template before allowing submission
- All workflow stages must have assigned approval roles before requests can progress to those stages
- Budget code and allocation information is required for financial approval stages in General Purchase and Asset Purchase workflows

### Data Format Standards

**Reference Number Generation**
- General Purchase requests use pattern "GP-{YYYY}-{00000}" with automatic sequential numbering
- Market List requests use pattern "ML-{YYYY}-{00000}" format for tracking and identification
- Asset Purchase requests follow specialized numbering for capital expenditure tracking
- Service requests maintain separate numbering sequence for non-tangible procurement

**Currency and Financial Data**
- All monetary amounts must include currency specification and exchange rate information

- Critical requests exceeding 200% of SLA time escalate to General Manager attention
- Emergency procurement requests bypass normal SLA requirements with special authorization

## Financial & Business Logic Rules

### Calculation Methods

**Budget Validation Processing**
- System compares request total against available departmental budget allocation
- Hard budget limits prevent approval when allocation is exceeded without override authority
- Soft budget warnings alert approvers when 80% of allocation is reached
- Multi-period budget calculations consider fiscal year allocation and year-to-date spending

**Currency Conversion Standards**
- Foreign currency requests convert to base currency using current exchange rates
- Exchange rate lock prevents rate fluctuation during approval processing

- Currency conversion fees are calculated and included in total cost analysis

### Pricing Rules

**Market List Pricing Validation**
- Market list items must be validated against current market pricing before approval
- Price deviations exceeding 15% from last purchase price require additional justification
- Vendor pricing must be verified through purchasing staff review process
- Emergency purchases may bypass pricing validation with appropriate authorization

- Emergency approval bypasses require appropriate emergency authorization roles

### Cross-Reference Checks

**Vendor and Product Validation**
- Requested items must reference valid vendor relationships and approved product catalogs
- Vendor credit terms and payment conditions affect approval routing and timing
- Product specifications must meet organizational standards and compliance requirements
- New vendor requests require additional approval steps and vendor qualification validation

**Budget and Department Consistency**
- Request department must match approver department authority or require cross-department approval
- Budget codes must be valid for the requesting department and current fiscal period

### Date Logic

**Request Date Processing**
- Request creation date establishes baseline for all SLA calculations and audit trails
- Approval dates must be sequential and cannot predate the previous stage completion
- Delivery dates cannot be earlier than minimum procurement lead time plus approval processing time
- Budget period validation ensures requests are processed within appropriate fiscal periods

### Deadline Management

**Critical Date Enforcement**
- Purchase requests for scheduled events must be submitted with adequate lead time
- Month-end budget reconciliation affects approval processing for final week submissions
- Year-end requests have accelerated approval requirements to ensure processing completion
