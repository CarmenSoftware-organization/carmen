## Business Rules & Validation

### Field Requirements
- **Mandatory Data:** GRN reference, vendor, receipt date, and status are required
- **Unique References:** GRN numbers must be unique across the system
- **Date Validation:** Receipt dates cannot be in the future
- **Currency Consistency:** All amounts must match the selected currency

### Status Workflow Logic
- **Status Progression:** Receipts follow defined workflow from Received â†’ Committed
- **Status Restrictions:** Certain statuses cannot be reversed without proper authorization
- **Partial Receipt Handling:** Items can be partially received with remaining quantities tracked

### Filter Validation Rules
- **Date Range Validation:** Ensure "from" dates are not after "to" dates in range filters
- **Numeric Validation:** Amount filters must contain valid numeric values
- **Required Field Logic:** Some advanced filters require minimum field combinations

### Data Integrity Constraints
- **Referenced Data:** Cannot delete GRNs that are referenced by other transactions
- **Inventory Integration:** Receipt status changes trigger inventory movement updates
- **Audit Trail:** All modifications are tracked in activity logs

## Current Limitations

### Mock Data Implementation
- **Test Data Source:** Currently uses hardcoded mock data instead of live database
- **Limited Sample Size:** Fixed set of sample GRNs for demonstration purposes
- **No Real-Time Updates:** Changes don't persist between sessions

### Placeholder Functionality
- **Export Feature:** Export button shows but doesn't generate actual file downloads
- **Print Functionality:** Print actions trigger console logging rather than actual printing
- **PDF Generation:** Download PDF option is not fully implemented

### Backend Integration Gaps
- **No API Connectivity:** No integration with actual backend services for data persistence
- **Missing Validation:** Server-side validation rules not implemented
- **Authentication Bypass:** Role-based restrictions not enforced at API level

### Advanced Features Pending
- **Real-Time Notifications:** No live updates when GRNs are modified by other users
- **Advanced Reporting:** Limited reporting capabilities beyond basic export
- **Workflow Automation:** Manual status changes rather than automated business rule enforcement
- **Integration Points:** No connection to inventory management or financial systems

### Performance Considerations
- **Client-Side Processing:** All filtering and sorting happens in browser
- **No Pagination Backend:** All data loaded at once rather than paginated server responses
- **Limited Scalability:** Current implementation won't handle large datasets efficiently

### Mobile & Accessibility
- **Touch Optimization:** Limited touch gesture support for mobile interactions
- **Screen Reader Support:** Basic accessibility implemented but not comprehensively tested
- **Offline Functionality:** No offline capability for field operations
