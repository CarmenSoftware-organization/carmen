## Role-Based Functionality

**All Inventory Users:**
- View balance reports for locations and categories within their access permissions
- Access movement history for transactions within their scope
- Use filtering and search capabilities for data analysis
- Print and export reports for offline analysis
- Navigate to related Stock Card views for detailed product information

**Department Managers:**
- Full access to balance reports for their assigned departments and locations
- Complete movement history visibility for their operational areas
- Advanced filtering capabilities across all available dimensions
- Export functionality for management reporting and analysis

**Financial Managers:**
- System-wide balance report access across all locations and categories
- Complete valuation method control with FIFO and Weighted Average options
- Full movement history access for financial reconciliation and audit purposes
- Comprehensive export capabilities for financial reporting integration

**Warehouse Staff:**
- Location-specific balance reports based on assigned warehouse areas
- Movement history focused on operational transactions and adjustments
- Basic filtering by location, category, and product ranges
- Print functionality for physical inventory verification processes

## Business Rules & Validation

**Report Generation Rules:**
- Balance calculations automatically update based on selected valuation method
- Inventory status badges update dynamically based on product-specific minimum/maximum thresholds  
- Lot display requires "Show Lots" toggle activation and availability of lot data
- Movement history displays transactions within selected date range with real-time filtering

**Data Accuracy Requirements:**
- Balance totals must reconcile across all hierarchical levels (location → category → product → lot)
- Quantity and value calculations respect selected valuation method (FIFO or Weighted Average)
- Movement records maintain before/after balance consistency for audit purposes
- Currency formatting displays consistently across all monetary values

**Filter Validation:**
- Date selections cannot exceed current system date for balance reporting
- Range filters (location, category, product) accept alphanumeric codes with proper validation
- Invalid filter combinations display appropriate error messages or warnings
- Filter combinations that return no results show "No results found" message

**Performance Considerations:**
- Loading states appear during data refresh operations with skeleton placeholders
- Large datasets implement pagination for movement history (10 items per page)
- Filter operations include debounced search to optimize performance
- Table expansion states persist during data refresh operations

## Current Limitations

**Mock Data Implementation:**
- All balance data currently loads from static mock data sources rather than live inventory database
- Movement history generates simulated transaction records instead of actual inventory movements
- Filter operations simulate API calls with setTimeout delays but don't affect actual data results
- Search functionality works on mock data but doesn't connect to backend search services

**Backend Integration Gaps:**
- Export functionality displays buttons but doesn't generate actual file downloads
- Print functionality shows button but doesn't implement actual print dialog integration
- Refresh button simulates data reload but doesn't fetch updated information from server
- Navigation to Stock Card page uses URL routing but may not pass proper context parameters

**Advanced Features Missing:**
- Real-time balance updates require manual refresh rather than automatic polling
- Advanced filter combinations (multiple location ranges, complex date ranges) not fully implemented
- Drill-down reporting beyond lot level not available (serial number tracking)
- Integration with other inventory functions (adjustments, transfers) shows navigation only

**Data Validation Limitations:**
- Inventory threshold calculations use hardcoded values rather than dynamic business rules
- Currency formatting uses basic implementation without multi-currency support
- Date range validation in movement history lacks business day and fiscal period awareness
- User permission filtering simulated but not enforced through actual role-based access control
