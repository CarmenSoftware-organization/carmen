## Implementation Overview

**Purpose**: The main dashboard provides an executive overview of the hotel supply chain system, offering real-time insights into procurement activities, inventory status, and operational performance through visual metrics, charts, and activity tracking.

**File Locations**: 
- Main component: `app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Header: `app/(main)/dashboard/components/dashboard-header.tsx`
- Metrics cards: `app/(main)/dashboard/components/dashboard-cards.tsx`
- Charts: `app/(main)/dashboard/components/dashboard-chart.tsx`
- Activity table: `app/(main)/dashboard/components/dashboard-data-table.tsx`

**User Types**: All authenticated users across different roles (Staff, Department Manager, Financial Manager, Purchasing Staff, Counter Staff, Chef) can access the dashboard with role-appropriate data visibility.

**Current Status**: Fully implemented with mock data. All visual components, charts, and interactive elements are functional. The dashboard displays static sample data for demonstration purposes.

## Business Rules & Validation

**Data Refresh Requirements**:
- Dashboard displays real-time data when connected to live backend systems
- Currently shows static mock data for demonstration purposes
- Metrics automatically update when underlying data changes
- Chart data reflects the most recent 6-month period

**Status Calculation Logic**:
- Critical Stock Items count items below predefined minimum threshold levels
- Orders Pending Approval shows items waiting for role-appropriate authorization
- Completed Deliveries calculates weekly completion metrics
- All status badges reflect current workflow states

**Chart Data Rules**:
- Order Trends chart aggregates monthly purchase order counts
- Spend Analysis converts financial data to thousands for readability
- Supplier Network Growth correlates active supplier count with order volume
- All charts maintain consistent time periods for accurate comparison

**Activity Display Rules**:
- Recent Activities table shows the most recent procurement and inventory activities
- Priority levels are assigned based on business impact and urgency
- Status updates reflect current workflow position for each activity
- Date stamps show when activities were last modified or created

**Access Control Validation**:
- Role-based visibility controls what data users can see
- Department context filters activities and metrics appropriately
- Financial information displays based on user permissions
- Sensitive data is hidden from users without appropriate access levels

## Current Limitations

**Mock Data Implementation**:
- All metrics, charts, and activities currently display static demonstration data
- No live backend integration for real-time data updates
- Percentage changes and trends are simulated rather than calculated from actual data
- Activity table shows sample procurement activities rather than live system data

**Placeholder Functionality**:
- Search functionality accepts input but does not perform actual searches
- Notification bell icon displays but does not show real notifications
- Settings gear icon provides access but leads to placeholder configuration
- Activity table action menus show options but do not perform actual operations

**Limited Interactivity**:
- Charts display data but do not support drill-down capabilities
- Clicking on metric cards does not navigate to detailed views
- Status badges are informational only and do not link to related records
- Recent activities do not link to the actual documents or records

**Backend Integration Gaps**:
- No API connections for fetching live dashboard data
- User context switching does not affect dashboard data display
- Role-based permissions are not enforced at the data level
- Real-time updates and notifications are not implemented

**Responsive Design Considerations**:
- Some chart elements may require optimization for very small screens
- Activity table may need horizontal scrolling on mobile devices
- Complex data visualization may be challenging on smaller displays
- Touch interactions for mobile users may need enhancement
