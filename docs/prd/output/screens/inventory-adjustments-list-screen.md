### Filter and Search Logic
- **Real-time Updates**: Search and filter results update immediately

- **Performance Optimization**: Large datasets are efficiently filtered

### Data Validation

- **Status Dependencies**: Certain actions only available for specific statuses

## Current Limitations

### Backend Integration
- **Mock Data**: Currently displays static mock data instead of live database records
- **API Connectivity**: No actual backend API calls implemented yet
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes don't persist across browser sessions
- **User Authentication**: Role-based permissions not connected to actual user management

### Advanced Features
- **Bulk Operations**: No multi-select or bulk action capabilities implemented
- **Advanced Reporting**: Limited to basic list view without analytical features
- **Export Functionality**: No options to export adjustment data to Excel/PDF

### Performance Considerations
