# Functional Specification Prompt Template

Create a comprehensive Functional Specification Document (FSD) for [FEATURE/COMPONENT NAME] based strictly on actual source code implementation and business requirements. Follow these guidelines:

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Source Code Analysis**: Document existing functionality from actual implementation - verify all features exist
2. **Business-Focused Language**: Use clear functional language, NO code snippets, variable names, or technical implementation details  
3. **User Journey Mapping**: Describe complete user workflows and system interactions
4. **Role-Based Functionality**: Define capabilities by user permissions and access levels
5. **Complete Traceability**: Every functional requirement must be verifiable in source code or existing business rules

## WRITING STYLE:

### DO:
- ✅ Focus on business outcomes: "Enables users to track vendor performance" not "displays vendor data"
- ✅ Describe complete workflows: "User searches → filters results → selects item → views details"
- ✅ Explain business value: "Approval workflow ensures financial control" not "status field updates"
- ✅ Use functional language: "System validates required information" not "form validation runs"
- ✅ Map user journeys: Start to finish process flows with decision points
- ✅ Define success scenarios: What constitutes successful completion of tasks

### DON'T:
- ❌ Include technical implementation details or code references
- ❌ Use database field names (use "Customer Name" not "customer.displayName")
- ❌ Reference UI framework components or event handlers
- ❌ Add functional requirements that don't exist in source code
- ❌ Focus on how things work instead of what they accomplish

## FUNCTIONAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:

Before finalizing, ensure:
- Every functional requirement can be demonstrated in the actual system
- All user workflows are complete and testable
- Business rules are clearly defined and verifiable
- Role-based access is documented with specific capabilities
- Integration points are identified and their current status noted
- Success criteria are measurable and achievable
- Document serves as a blueprint for testing and validation

## EXAMPLE FUNCTIONAL TRANSFORMATIONS:

Instead of: "onClick handler validates form fields"
Write: "System prevents submission when required business information is incomplete"

Instead of: "useState manages approval status"  
Write: "Approval status tracks items through the business review process"

Instead of: "API call updates backend database"
Write: "Changes are saved to the system and immediately available to other users"

Instead of: "useRole hook checks permissions"
Write: "System ensures users can only perform actions appropriate to their business role"

## TESTING ALIGNMENT:

This functional specification should enable:
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Business users can verify workflows meet their needs
- **Integration Testing**: Technical teams can validate system connections work properly
- **Role-Based Testing**: Security teams can verify access controls function correctly
- **Process Testing**: Business analysts can confirm workflows support business operations

## DELIVERABLE STRUCTURE:

The completed functional specification should read like a business manual that:
- Explains what the system does from a user perspective
- Documents all supported business processes
- Defines success criteria for each functional area
- Serves as the foundation for user training and system testing
- Bridges business requirements and technical implementation

This approach ensures functional specifications that accurately reflect current capabilities while clearly defining business value and user workflows for all stakeholders.
