**Dependencies**: Integration with POS systems, temperature monitoring sensors, inventory management system, staff training programs, and regulatory reporting systems.

## Food Safety Rules

### Critical Control Point Management

**Temperature Control Requirements**: All fractional items must maintain safe temperatures according to HACCP guidelines. Hot foods must be held at 140°F or above, cold foods at 41°F or below.

**Holding Time Limits**: System enforces maximum holding times for food safety compliance. Pizza slices cannot exceed 4 hours in hot holding, cake slices requiring refrigeration cannot exceed 2 hours at room temperature.

**Cross-Contamination Prevention**: Cutting tools and surfaces must be sanitized between different product types, especially when allergens are involved. System blocks fractional item creation when proper sanitation protocols are not followed.

**Documentation Requirements**: All food safety violations trigger automatic documentation including timestamp, location, responsible staff member, and corrective actions taken.

### Sanitation Protocol Enforcement

**Equipment Sanitization**: Cutting tools must be sanitized every 2 hours or between different product categories, whichever occurs first. System tracks sanitization timestamps and prevents operations when compliance lapses.

**Surface Cleanliness**: Cutting surfaces must be cleaned and sanitized between different allergen categories. System maintains allergen status tracking for all work surfaces.

**Staff Hygiene Monitoring**: Hand washing and glove changes are required before handling fractional items. System integration with hand washing stations tracks compliance.

## Quality Control Rules

### Pizza Slice Standards

**Size Consistency Requirements**: Pizza slices must fall within 85-115% of standard size specifications. System calculates slice consistency using diameter measurements and slice count validation.

**Appearance Quality Thresholds**: Visual quality scores must meet minimum standards of 7 out of 10. Slices falling below threshold receive automatic markdowns or disposal recommendations.

**Serving Temperature Standards**: Pizza slices must maintain serving temperature of 140°F minimum. System monitors display case temperatures and triggers alerts when thresholds are exceeded.

### Cake Portion Standards

**Weight Consistency Control**: Cake slices must maintain weight within 10 grams of target portion size. System tracks portion weights and flags deviations exceeding tolerance levels.

**Presentation Quality Requirements**: Cake slices must meet visual presentation standards including clean cuts, intact frosting, and proper garnish placement. Quality scores below 8 out of 10 trigger review protocols.

**Freshness Indicators**: Cake freshness is monitored through visual inspection scores and time-since-preparation tracking. Items exceeding freshness thresholds receive automatic price adjustments or removal recommendations.

## Operational Workflow Rules

### Cutting Procedure Standards

**Tool Selection Requirements**: Appropriate cutting tools must be selected based on product type. Pizza wheels for pizza items, sharp knives for cake items, with tool sanitization verified before use.

**Portion Size Calculations**: System calculates optimal portion sizes based on whole item dimensions and target slice count. Deviations from calculated portions require manager approval.

**Timing Requirements**: Cutting operations must be completed within specified time windows to maintain food quality and safety. Pizza cutting must occur within 10 minutes of removal from oven.

### Storage and Display Rules

**Temperature Zone Compliance**: Fractional items must be stored in appropriate temperature zones immediately after cutting. Hot items in heated displays, cold items in refrigerated cases within 30 minutes of cutting.

**Display Duration Limits**: Maximum display times are enforced to maintain quality and safety. Pizza slices maximum 4 hours hot display, cake slices maximum 8 hours refrigerated display.

**Inventory Rotation Protocol**: First-in-first-out rotation is enforced for all fractional items. System tracks cutting timestamps and prioritizes older items for sale recommendations.

## Inventory Management Rules

### Minimum Level Maintenance

**Dynamic Threshold Calculation**: Minimum inventory levels are calculated based on historical demand patterns, day of week, time of day, and seasonal factors. System adjusts thresholds automatically based on sales velocity.

**Reorder Point Automation**: When fractional item inventory falls below minimum levels during peak periods, system automatically triggers production requests with priority levels based on urgency.

**Buffer Stock Requirements**: Safety stock levels are maintained based on demand variability and preparation lead times. Higher variability items maintain larger buffer stocks.

### Waste Minimization Controls

**Overproduction Prevention**: System monitors waste percentages and triggers production adjustments when waste exceeds 15% threshold. Production recommendations consider historical demand and current inventory levels.

**Price Adjustment Automation**: When items approach expiration or quality decline thresholds, system automatically applies tiered discounts: 10% at 75% of shelf life, 25% at 90% of shelf life.

**Disposal Authorization**: Items requiring disposal due to safety or quality concerns require manager authorization. System documents disposal reasons and calculates waste costs for analysis.

## Pricing and Revenue Rules

### Dynamic Pricing Controls

**Time-Based Adjustments**: Pricing adjustments are applied based on time of day and demand patterns. Premium pricing during peak hours, discounts during slow periods to optimize revenue and reduce waste.

**Quality-Based Pricing**: Items with quality scores below optimal levels receive automatic discounts proportional to quality reduction. Critical quality issues block sales entirely.

### Margin Protection Rules

**Minimum Margin Enforcement**: System enforces minimum margin requirements for all fractional sales. Prices cannot be reduced below cost-plus-minimum-margin thresholds without management override.

**Competition Monitoring**: When competitor pricing information is available, system provides alerts when pricing significantly exceeds competitive benchmarks.

## Compliance and Audit Rules

### Regulatory Compliance Monitoring

**Health Department Requirements**: System ensures all operations comply with local health department regulations including temperature logs, time stamps, and staff certifications.

**HACCP Compliance**: Critical control points are monitored continuously with automatic alerts when parameters exceed acceptable ranges. All deviations trigger immediate corrective action protocols.

### Documentation and Reporting

**Audit Trail Maintenance**: Complete audit trail is maintained for all fractional item operations including cutting, storage, sales, and disposal activities with staff identification and timestamps.

**Violation Tracking**: System tracks all rule violations with severity classification, corrective actions taken, and resolution verification. Repeat violations trigger escalated response protocols.

**Performance Reporting**: Regular compliance reports are generated showing rule adherence rates, violation trends, and improvement opportunities with management recommendations.

## Exception Handling Rules

### Emergency Override Procedures

**Manager Override Authority**: Managers can override specific rules in emergency situations with required justification and documentation. All overrides are logged and require subsequent review.

**Equipment Failure Protocols**: When monitoring equipment fails, manual processes are activated with increased inspection frequency and documentation requirements until equipment is restored.

### Quality Exception Management

**Salvage Procedures**: Items failing quality standards may be salvaged through reprocessing if food safety is not compromised. Salvage operations require quality officer approval.

**Customer Complaint Response**: Customer quality complaints trigger immediate investigation including item inspection, process review, and corrective action implementation.

## Training and Competency Rules

### Staff Certification Requirements

**Food Safety Training**: All staff handling fractional items must maintain current food safety certifications. System tracks certification expiration dates and blocks access for expired certifications.

**Procedure Competency**: Staff must demonstrate competency in cutting procedures, quality assessment, and safety protocols through periodic evaluations and skill verification.

### Continuous Improvement Rules

**Performance Monitoring**: Individual staff performance is monitored through quality metrics, compliance rates, and waste generation. Performance feedback drives additional training recommendations.

**Process Optimization**: System continuously analyzes operational data to identify improvement opportunities in cutting procedures, inventory management, and quality control processes.

## Integration and System Rules

### Technology Integration Requirements

**POS System Synchronization**: Fractional item availability and pricing must be synchronized with POS systems in real-time to prevent sales of unavailable items or incorrect pricing.

**Sensor Data Integration**: Temperature and environmental sensors provide continuous monitoring data that feeds directly into compliance monitoring and alert systems.

### Data Management Rules

**Data Retention Requirements**: All operational data related to fractional sales must be retained for minimum periods required by regulatory authorities and business analysis needs.

**Privacy Protection**: Staff performance data and customer information associated with compliance activities must be protected according to privacy regulations and company policies.

## Performance Standards

### Key Performance Indicators

**Compliance Score Targets**: Overall compliance score must maintain 95% or higher with no critical violations exceeding 24 hours without resolution.

**Quality Score Maintenance**: Average quality scores must remain above 8.5 out of 10 with less than 5% of items falling below acceptable thresholds.

**Waste Reduction Goals**: Food waste from fractional items must not exceed 12% of total production with continuous improvement targets of 2% annual reduction.

### Corrective Action Requirements

**Response Time Standards**: Critical violations require immediate response within 30 minutes, major violations within 2 hours, minor violations within 8 hours.

**Resolution Verification**: All corrective actions must be verified by appropriate authority levels and documented with evidence of effectiveness before cases are closed.

This business rules specification serves as the operational foundation for fractional sales management, ensuring food safety, quality control, operational efficiency, and regulatory compliance while supporting business objectives of revenue optimization and waste minimization.
