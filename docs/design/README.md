## Design Principles

The Carmen F&B Management System follows these key design principles:

1. **Consistency** - Maintain consistent UI patterns and interactions across all modules
2. **Modularity** - Design components and features to be reusable and independent
3. **Scalability** - Ensure the system can handle increasing data volumes and user loads
4. **Maintainability** - Structure code and documentation to facilitate easy maintenance
5. **Usability** - Prioritize user experience and intuitive interfaces

## Design Process

When creating new features or modules:

1. Start with business requirements analysis
2. Create wireframes and user flows
3. Design component architecture
4. Implement with adherence to system-wide specifications
5. Test against design specifications
6. Document design decisions and implementation details
