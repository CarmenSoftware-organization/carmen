# Product Requirements Document: Advanced Filter Component

## Overview
The Advanced Filter Component is a reusable UI element designed for Carmen Supply Chain platform that allows users to create, save, and apply complex filters across all list screens and reports. The component will handle large datasets (up to 1M records), support multiple filter types, and work across desktop and mobile devices.

## Business Case
An advanced filtering capability will significantly enhance user productivity and data analysis by:
- Reducing time spent searching through large datasets
- Enabling consistent filtering across the platform
- Allowing users to save and reuse complex filter configurations
- Supporting all user types from support teams to end users

## User Personas
- **Support Manager**: Needs to filter customer data efficiently when planning new setups
- **Support Team**: Requires detailed filtering when implementing new schemas
- **Finance Staff**: Uses filters to find specific billing and subscription information
- **Platform Manager**: Monitors platform metrics with custom filters
- **Cluster Admin Manager**: Filters business unit and user data
- **Business Unit Manager**: Analyzes business unit specific data
- **End Users**: Filter relevant data for daily operations

## Technical Specifications

### Frontend Implementation
- **Framework**: Next.js with React 18+
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: React Context or Redux for filter state
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **API Communication**: React Query for efficient data fetching and caching

### Backend Implementation

- **Query Building**: TypeORM or Prisma with dynamic query generation
- **Caching**: Redis for storing frequently used filter results
- **Pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for large datasets

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/filters` - Get saved filters
- `POST /api/filters` - Create new filter
- `PUT /api/filters/:id` - Update existing filter
- `DELETE /api/filters/:id` - Delete filter
- `POST /api/apply-filter` - Apply filter and get results

### Data Model

```typescript
// Filter Definition
interface FilterDefinition {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  createdBy: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  isPublic: boolean;
  tags: string[];
  conditions: FilterCondition[];
}

// Filter Condition
interface FilterCondition {
  id: string;
  fieldName: string;
  fieldType: 'text' | 'number' | 'date' | 'boolean' | 'dropdown' | 'lookup';
  operator: FilterOperator;
  value: any;
  group?: string;
  logicalOperator?: 'AND' | 'OR';
}

// Different operators based on field type
type FilterOperator = 
  | 'equals' | 'notEquals' 
  | 'contains' | 'notContains' | 'startsWith' | 'endsWith'
  | 'greaterThan' | 'lessThan' | 'between'
  | 'before' | 'after' | 'on' | 'notOn' | 'inRange'
  | 'isTrue' | 'isFalse'
  | 'in' | 'notIn'
  | 'isNull' | 'isNotNull';
```

## UI Components
