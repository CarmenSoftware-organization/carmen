# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Procurement module implementation and refinement
- Purchase Request list component optimization and patterns
- Type-safe component patterns for list-detail views
- Performance optimization for data handling
- UI component refinement across procurement module

## Recent Changes
1. Purchase Request List Component Updates
   - Implemented `sortConfig` object pattern for sorted data
   - Created clear separation between search, filters, and actions
   - Implemented justify-between spacing for improved layout
   - Updated mock data structure to match API requirements
   - Fixed TypeScript linting errors and improved type safety
   - Added consistent filtering patterns

2. Procurement Module Structure
   - Established list-detail pattern for purchase requests
   - Set up consistent component architecture
   - Created reusable patterns for other procurement components
   - Implemented type-safe interfaces for data models

3. Component Setup
   - Initialized Shadcn UI components
   - Set up base component structure
   - Implemented theme switching
   - Created consistent layout patterns

## Active Decisions
1. Procurement Module Architecture
   - List-detail pattern for all procurement entities
   - Consistent sorting and filtering implementation
   - Clear separation of search, filter, and action buttons
   - Type-safe table implementation with strong typing
   - Tabbed interfaces for detail views
   - Shared mock data structures

2. Data Handling Patterns
   - Using SortConfig object for sorting state
   - Implementing filtering with useMemo for performance
   - Consistent approach to pagination
   - Clear type definitions for all data models
   - Memoization of sorted and filtered data

3. Component Architecture
   - Server-first component approach
   - Minimal client-side JavaScript
   - Type-safe props and events
   - Consistent styling patterns
   - Reusable patterns across modules

## Current Considerations
1. UI/UX Improvements
   - Optimizing filter and search layout
   - Improving action button visibility
   - Enhancing table readability
   - Ensuring mobile responsiveness
   - Consistent user experience across all procurement screens

2. Performance
   - Monitoring bundle sizes
   - Optimizing component renders with proper memoization
   - Reducing client-side JavaScript
   - Improving load times for data-heavy tables
   - Efficient data filtering and sorting

3. Type Safety
   - Strict TypeScript configuration
   - Proper interface definitions for all data models
   - Generic type patterns for reusable components
   - Type-safe API calls and mock data

4. Workflow Integration
   - Integrating approval workflows
   - Status tracking and visualization
   - Proper permissions handling
   - Status-based UI adaptations

## Next Steps
1. Short Term
   - Complete purchase order list component using same patterns
   - Implement goods received note list component
   - Connect detail views with list components
   - Set up state management for real API data

2. Medium Term
   - Implement complete procurement workflow
   - Connect with inventory management module
   - Add vendor management features
   - Add reporting capabilities

3. Long Term
   - Scale application to all F&B operations modules
   - Add advanced features like forecasting
   - Optimize for production deployment
   - Improve developer experience with better documentation

## Active Issues
1. Technical Patterns
   - Need consistent approach to table sorting and filtering across all list components
   - Need standardized approach to detail view tabs

2. Bugs
   - None currently identified

3. Improvements Needed
   - Additional component documentation
   - Performance benchmarking for large datasets
   - Accessibility testing across all components
   - Comprehensive test coverage

## Development Status
- Procurement module in active development
- Core component patterns established
- List components being implemented
- Ready for detail view development
