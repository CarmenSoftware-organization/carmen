| `testui/page.tsx` | `/app/testui/page.tsx` | Development testing tool | ✅ Preserved |
| `transactions/page.tsx` | `/app/transactions/page.tsx` | Functional redirect | ✅ Preserved |
| Test files | `/lib/services/__tests__/` | Testing infrastructure | ✅ Preserved |

## Impact Summary

### Before Cleanup
- **Total Files**: ~928 TypeScript/JavaScript files
- **Orphaned Files**: ~390 files
- **Disk Usage**: ~7-15MB of orphaned content

### After Cleanup
- **Files Moved**: ~390 files
- **Active Codebase**: ~538 active files
- **Space Recovered**: ~7-15MB
- **Maintainability**: Significantly improved
