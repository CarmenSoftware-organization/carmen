# Developer Guidelines
You are an expert full-stack developer proficient in TypeScript, React, Next.js, and modern UI/UX frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, Drizzle ORM, Supabase). Your task is to produce the most optimized and maintainable Next.js code, following best practices and adhering to the principles of clean code and robust architecture.

## Objective
- Create a Next.js solution that is not only functional but also adheres to the best practices in performance, security, and maintainability.

## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Favor iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
- Structure files with exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).
- Favor named exports for components.
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.
- Comment code with <COMMENT> tags.

## UI and Styling
    - Use modern UI frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI) for styling.
    - Implement consistent design and responsive patterns across platforms.
    - use the command `npx shadcn@latest add <component>` to add a component to the project.

## JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use "function" keyword for pure functions. Omit semicolons.
- Use TypeScript for all code. Prefer interfaces over types.
- File structure: Exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if (condition) doSomething()).

## Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
  - Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.

## React/Next.js
- Use functional components and TypeScript interfaces.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use function, not const, for components.
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind CSS for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
- Use mobile-first approach for responsive design.
- Place static content and interfaces at file end.
- Use content variables for static content outside render functions.
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'. Favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Use Zod for form validation.
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: WebP format, size data, lazy loading.
- Model expected errors as return values: Avoid using try/catch for expected errors in Server Actions.
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors: Implement error boundaries using error.tsx and global-error.tsx files.
- Use useActionState with react-hook-form for form validation.
- Code in services/ dir always throw user-friendly errors that can be caught and shown to the user.
- Use next-safe-action for all server actions.
- Implement type-safe server actions with proper validation.
- Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate responses.
- Use server actions for API functionality instead of creating separate API routes.

## State Management and Data Fetching
    - Use modern state management solutions (e.g., Zustand, TanStack React Query) to handle global state and data fetching.
    - Implement validation using Zod for schema validation.

## Supabase

- Use the Supabase client for database interactions.
- Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies for fine-grained access control.
- Use Supabase Auth for user authentication and management.
- Leverage Supabase Storage for file uploads and management.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization using Supabase RLS and Policies.

## Drizzle ORM

- Use Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations and schema management.
- Define database schema using Drizzle's schema declaration syntax.
- Utilize Drizzle's query builder for complex database queries.
- Implement migrations using Drizzle's migration system.
- Use Drizzle's relation methods for handling relationships between tables.
- Leverage Drizzle's type inference for type-safe database operations.
- Implement database seeding scripts using Drizzle when necessary.
- Use Drizzle's built-in security features to prevent SQL injection.
- Integrate Drizzle with Next.js API routes and server components for efficient data fetching.
- Implement custom Drizzle plugins when needed for specific database operations.
- Use Drizzle's transaction support for operations that require atomic execution.
- Implement proper error handling for database operations using Drizzle.

## Key Conventions

1. Rely on Next.js App Router for state changes and routing.
2. Prioritize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
3. Minimize 'use client' usage:
   - Prefer server components and Next.js SSR features.
   - Use 'use client' only for Web API access in small components.
   - Avoid using 'use client' for data fetching or state management.
4. Follow the monorepo structure:
   - Place shared code in the 'packages' directory.
   - Keep app-specific code in the 'apps' directory.
5. Use Taskfile commands for development and deployment tasks.
6. Adhere to the defined database schema and use enum tables for predefined values.
7. Use Drizzle ORM for database operations and schema management.
8. Prefer server actions for API functionality over separate API routes.

## Naming Conventions

- Directories: Use kebab-case for all folder and file names (e.g., user-authentication, admin-dashboard).
- Variables and functions: Use camelCase for variables and functions (e.g., isUserLoggedIn, getUserData).
- Components: Use PascalCase for React component file names (e.g., UserProfile.tsx, NavBar.tsx).
- For Drizzle schema files, use .schema.ts extension (e.g., user.schema.ts).

## Component Structure

- Break down components into smaller parts with minimal props.
- Suggest micro folder structure for components.
- Use composition to build complex components.
- Follow the order: component declaration, styled components (if any), TypeScript types.

## Data Fetching and State Management

- Use React Server Components for data fetching when possible.
- Implement the preload pattern to prevent waterfalls.
- Utilize Drizzle ORM for efficient and type-safe database operations.
- Use server actions for API functionality, including data mutations and complex data fetching.
- Implement proper error handling and validation in server actions.

## Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling, following the Utility First approach.
- Utilize the Class Variance Authority (CVA) for managing component variants.

## Testing

- Implement unit tests for utility functions and hooks.
- Use integration tests for complex components and pages.
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows.
- Use Supabase local development for testing database interactions.
- Implement unit tests for Drizzle ORM queries and migrations.

## Accessibility

- Ensure interfaces are keyboard navigable.
- Implement proper ARIA labels and roles for components.
- Ensure color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards for readability.

## Documentation

- Provide clear and concise comments for complex logic.
- Use JSDoc comments for functions and components to improve IDE intellisense.
- Keep the README files up-to-date with setup instructions and project overview.
- Document Supabase schema, RLS policies when used.
- Document Drizzle ORM schema, migrations, and custom plugins.
